Determining the physical nature of\nwavefunctions remains an open problem that is at the very core of quantum\nmechanics, About a decade ago, Pusey, Barrett and Rudolf (PBR) claimed to prove\nan ontologically real status of wavefunctions by ruling out $\\psi$-epistemic\nmodels. The result was obtained by associating wavefunctions to hypothetical\ndistributions of notional physical states, and by examining whether some\nphysical states were associated with more than one wavefunction, a criterion\nthey chose for defining a wavefunction as `epistemic'. I show that the starting\nassumption in the PBR argument, of associating a wavefunction with a\ndistribution of physical states, is flawed and contradictory to the linear\nstructure of quantum mechanics coupled with its quadratic Born's rule. Since\nnone of the axioms or calculations of observable statistical results in the\nstandard quantum theory depends on specifying the physical nature of a\n$\\psi$-function, the considerations in the PBR paper, involving a standard\nprocess of the preparation and projective measurements of quantum states,\ncannot address the ontological status of the wavefunctions in space and time."}

However, the underlying\nsymmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the\norder parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires\nfurther verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by\nitself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to\nnumerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in\nquantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy\neffective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a\nvery small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of\nstates in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent)\nsymmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement\nspectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after\ncooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis."}

In this work, we investigate\nhow individual two-body operators influence the global dynamics of circuits\ncomposed of dual-unitaries.

A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to\nsuperconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally\ncharged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has\nmostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how\nanyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show\nthat such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern\ninsulators (FCIs) at fillings $\\nu = 2/(4p \\mp 1)$ when they are driven toward\na quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the\ntransition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional\ncharge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we\nanalyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model.\nTensor network simulations at $\\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with\nincreasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable\nsemion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state\ncompeting with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this\ntransition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our\ntheory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons.\nDoping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and\ncharge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central\ncharge $c = \\pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our\nframework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it\nwith strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\\'e materials\nsuch as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$."}

However, we show that in the\ncase of a repulsively bound state, the dynamics becomes abnormally slow when\nnext-nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping is allowed for the particles. We show that\nsuch slowing down occurs for some magic strength of the NNN hopping at which\nthe bound state band exhibits a quasi-flatband feature. We reveal this\nanomalous dynamical behavior by analyzing the quench dynamics of two nearest\nneighbor (NN) spin excitations (magnons) on a ferromagnetic chain by allowing\nboth NN and NNN couplings. By implementing digital quantum computing\nsimulations on a NISQ device, we obtain such non-trivial signatures and\ncomplement the results with exact numerical calculations. Moreover, through\nperturbative arguments, we reveal that the slowing down is due to the\ndestructive interference between different paths associated to the bound state\ndynamics."}

Quantum Computing (QC) offers a\npromising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic\napproaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been\nexplored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the\ndimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches\neither simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work\nintroduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph\nautoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node\nfeatures. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream\nclassification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical\nclassifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a\nclassification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that\ninvolves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons.\nThe GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing\nstep and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results\ndemonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the\ntesting of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets."}

The fundamental mechanisms underlying\nquantum computation required the development and construction of quantum\ncomputers. These devices are referred to as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale\nQuantum) devices. Not only are NISQ devices extremely limited in their qubit\ncount but they also suffer from noise during computation and this problem only\ngets worse as the size of the circuit increases which limits the practical use\nof quantum computers for modern day applications. This paper will focus on\nutilizing quantum circuit partitioning to overcome the inherent issues of NISQ\ndevices. Partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits has allowed\nfor the execution of quantum circuits that are too large to fit on one quantum\ndevice. There have been many previous approaches to quantum circuit\npartitioning and each of these approaches differ in how they work with some\nfocusing on hardware-aware partitioning, optimal graph-based partitioning,\nmulti-processor architectures and many more. These approaches achieve success\nin their objective but they often fail to scale well which impacts cost and\nnoise. The ultimate goal of this paper is to mitigate these issues by\nminimizing 3 important metrics; noise, time and cost. To achieve this we use\ndynamic partitioning for practical circuit cutting and we take advantage of the\nbenefits of hybrid execution where classical computation will be used alongside\nquantum hardware. This approach has proved to be beneficial with respect to\nnoise with classical execution enabling a 42.30% reduction in noise and a 40%\nreduction in the number of qubits required in cases where a mixture of\nclassical and quantum computation were required."}
