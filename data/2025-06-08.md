### [1] [Ruling out nonlinear modifications of quantum theory with contextuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04298)
*Ruben Campos Delgado,Martin Plávala*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨非线性量子理论修改可能导致量子系统失去上下文性，从而允许经典隐变量模型存在，并提出实验验证方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非线性量子理论修改是否会导致量子系统失去上下文性，进而为量子引力理论提供线索。

Method: 分析Deutsch's map、Weinberg's model和Schrödinger-Newton方程等非线性修改对量子系统上下文性的影响。

Result: 发现这些非线性修改会将上下文性状态映射为非上下文性状态，允许经典隐变量模型存在。

Conclusion: 提出实验设计以验证非线性修改是否被排除，并指出非线性修改可能导致弱波函数坍缩，解决测量问题。

Abstract: Nonlinear modifications of quantum theory are considered potential candidates
for the theory of quantum gravity, with the intuitive argument that since
Einstein field equations are nonlinear, quantum gravity should be nonlinear as
well. Contextuality is a property of quantum systems that forbids the
explanation of prepare-and-measure experiments in terms of classical hidden
variable models with suitable properties. We show that some well-known
nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics, namely the Deutsch's map, the
Weinberg's model, and the Schr\"odinger - Newton equation, map a contextual set
of states to a non-contextual one. That is, the considered nonlinear
modifications of quantum theory allow for the existence of classical hidden
variable models for certain experimental setups. This enables us to design
experiments that would rule out the considered nonlinear modifications of
quantum theory by verifying that the system remains contextual, or,
equivalently, our results highlight a mechanism how nonlinear modification of
quantum theory may lead to weak wave function collapse and ultimately to the
solution of the measurement problem.

### [2] [Entanglement suppression and quantum scars in a three-oscillator gravitational analogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04300)
*P. George Christopher,S. Shankaranarayanan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究耦合谐振子三体系统中的量子关联，发现某些参数下远距离振子间的纠缠消失，类似量子疤痕现象，挑战了量子引力的纠缠测试方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子引力提案中类似中介诱导的相互作用，研究其量子关联特性。

Method: 分析三体耦合谐振子系统，分为重中介和轻中介两种参数区域，研究纠缠行为和动力学稳定性。

Result: 重中介区域中纠缠局限于参数空间的小岛，类似量子疤痕；轻中介区域则表现出平滑的纠缠生成。

Conclusion: 纠缠缺失不一定意味着经典中介，可能是动态约束的量子子空间，强调需探测中介动力学以诊断量子引力。

Abstract: We study quantum correlations in a tripartite system of coupled harmonic
oscillators, modeling mediator-induced interactions akin to those in quantum
gravity proposals. Surprisingly, despite the system's integrability, we
identify regimes where bipartite entanglement between distant oscillators
vanishes even with non-zero quantum couplings. In the Heavy Mediator Regime,
entanglement is restricted to sharply localized islands in parameter space,
surrounded by extended regions of suppression, analogous to quantum scars in
non-integrable systems. Fidelity analysis reveal that these low-entanglement
states exhibit dynamical stability and spectral signatures reminiscent of
quantum scars in non-integrable systems, suggesting a continuous-variable
analogue of scarring tied to hidden phase-space symmetries. The Light Mediator
Regime, by contrast, displays smooth entanglement generation. These results
challenge entanglement-based tests of quantum gravity: the absence of
entanglement need not imply classical mediation but may instead reflect a
mediator dynamically constrained to a quantum subspace-akin to gravitational
memory or decoherence-free subspaces. Our findings emphasize the necessity of
probing the mediator's dynamical regime to unambiguously diagnose quantum
gravity.

### [3] [Superconducting antiqubits achieve optimal phase estimation via unitary inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04315)
*Xingrui Song,Surihan Sean Borjigin,Flavio Salvati,Yu-Xin Wang,Nicole Yunger Halpern,David R. M. Arvidsson-Shukur,Kater Murch*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 通过将超导量子比特（transmon）模拟为正电子（positron），实现了时间反演操作，并在量子相位估计中展示了量子优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用模拟反物质（antiqubits）实现平台特定的时间反演操作，以提升量子信息处理的性能。

Method: 将transmon量子比特模拟为正电子，通过特定共振和非共振驱动实现时间反演，并利用qubit-antiqubit纠缠提升相位估计的灵敏度。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证了qubit-antiqubit纠缠传感器在相位估计中具有最高的Fisher信息灵敏度。

Conclusion: 模拟反物质可用于平台特定的时间反演操作，为量子信息处理带来实际优势。

Abstract: A positron is equivalent to an electron traveling backward through time.
Casting transmon superconducting qubits as akin to electrons, we simulate a
positron with a transmon subject to particular resonant and off-resonant
drives. We call positron-like transmons "antiqubits." An antiqubit's effective
gyromagnetic ratio equals the negative of a qubit's. This fact enables us to
time-invert a unitary implemented on a transmon by its environment. We apply
this platform-specific unitary inversion, with qubit--antiqubit entanglement,
to achieve a quantum advantage in phase estimation: consider measuring the
strength of a field that points in an unknown direction. An entangled
qubit--antiqubit sensor offers the greatest possible sensitivity (amount of
Fisher information), per qubit, per application of the field. We prove this
result theoretically and observe it experimentally. This work shows how
antimatter, whether real or simulated, can enable platform-specific unitary
inversion and benefit quantum information processing.

### [4] [Efficient Quantum Gibbs Sampling with Local Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04321)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种避免昂贵块编码、仅依赖密集局部电路的量子热态制备方法，适用于近量子设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子系统中热行为的模拟是量子计算的核心挑战，现有方法效率不足。

Result: 在高温度下快速混合，误差小，数值模拟显示适用于当前量子硬件。

Conclusion: 首次提供了可实现的量子热化协议，为平衡量子现象模拟铺路。

Abstract: The problem of simulating the thermal behavior of quantum systems remains a
central open challenge in quantum computing. Unlike well-established quantum
algorithms for unitary dynamics, \emph{provably efficient} algorithms for
preparing thermal states -- crucial for probing equilibrium behavior -- became
available only recently with breakthrough algorithms based on the simulation of
well-designed dissipative processes, a quantum-analogue to Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We show a way to implement these algorithms avoiding
expensive block encoding and relying only on dense local circuits, akin to
Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically, our method leverages spatial truncation
and Trotterization of exact quasilocal dissipative processes. We rigorously
prove that the approximations we use have little effect on rapid mixing at high
temperatures and allow convergence to the thermal state with small bounded
error. Moreover, we accompany our analytical results with numerical simulations
that show that this method, unlike previously thought, is within the reach of
current generation of quantum hardware. These results provide the first
provably efficient quantum thermalization protocol implementable on near-term
quantum devices, offering a concrete path toward practical simulation of
equilibrium quantum phenomena.

Conclusion: 实验揭示了耗散多体系统的普遍光谱特征，并证明当前量子计算平台可用于研究耗散多体现象。

Abstract: More than four decades of research on chaos in isolated quantum systems have
led to the identification of universal signatures -- such as level repulsion
and eigenstate thermalization -- that serve as cornerstones in our
understanding of complex quantum dynamics. The emerging field of dissipative
quantum chaos explores how these properties manifest in open quantum systems,
where interactions with the environment play an essential role. We report the
first experimental detection of dissipative quantum chaos and integrability by
measuring the complex spacing ratios (CSRs) of open many-body quantum systems
implemented on a high-fidelity superconducting quantum processor. Employing
gradient-based tomography, we retrieve a ``donut-shaped'' CSR distribution for
chaotic dissipative circuits, a hallmark of level repulsion in open quantum
systems. For an integrable circuit, spectral correlations vanish, evidenced by
a sharp peak at the origin in the CSR distribution. As we increase the depth of
the integrable dissipative circuit, the CSR distribution undergoes an
integrability-to-chaos crossover, demonstrating that intrinsic noise in the
quantum processor is a dissipative chaotic process. Our results reveal the
universal spectral features of dissipative many-body systems and establish
present-day quantum computation platforms, which are predominantly used to run
unitary simulations, as testbeds to explore dissipative many-body phenomena.

### [6] [Lévy Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04343)
*Budhaditya Bhattacharjee,William E. Salazar,Dario Rosa,Alexei Andreanov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了4费米子Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev模型在Lévy Stable分布下的谱特性，发现随着分布尾部变厚，模型从混沌行为过渡到可积行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 通过分析特征值分布的长短程关联和极端统计，采用分层方法研究Lévy Stable分布的多重分形层次。

Result: 模型展示了从混沌到可积行为的交叉，这与Lévy随机矩阵中的迁移边控制的转变不同。

Conclusion: 讨论了模型的解析性及可能的精确转变模型。

Abstract: We explore the spectral properties of the $4$-fermion Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
with interaction sourced from a L\'evy Stable (fat-tailed) distribution. L\'evy
random matrices are known to demonstrate non-ergodic behaviour through the
emergence of a mobility edge. We study the eigenvalue distribution, focusing on
long- and short-range correlations and extreme statistics. This model
demonstrates a crossover from chaotic to integrable behaviour (in the spectral
correlations) as the distribution becomes increasingly fat-tailed. We
investigate this crossover through a hierarchical analysis of the eigenvalue
spectrum, based on the multi-fractal hierarchy of the L\'evy Stable
distribution. The crossover is explained in terms of a genuine many-body
effect, distinct from the transition (controlled by a mobility edge) in the
L\'evy random matrices. We conclude with comments on the model's solvability
and discussion of possible models with exact transitions.

### [7] [Exponential distillation of dominant eigenproperties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04380)

Result: 算法复杂度与问题哈密顿量的能隙直接相关，与现有混合技术相当。数值模拟展示了其在近期和早期容错场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在100量子比特示例中展示了通过张量网络技术预测基态和激发态性质的能力，被视为一种量子启发的经典方法。

Abstract: Estimating observable expectation values in eigenstates of quantum systems
has a broad range of applications and is an area where early fault-tolerant
quantum computers may provide practical quantum advantage. We develop a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm that enables the estimation of an arbitrary
observable expectation value in an eigenstate, given an initial state is
supplied that has dominant overlap with the targeted eigenstate -- but may
overlap with any other eigenstates. Our approach builds on, and is conceptually
similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves
exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the
quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in
the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then
virtually purified with exponential efficacy. We prove rigorous performance
guarantees and conclude that the complexity of our approach depends directly on
the energy gap in the problem Hamiltonian, and is thus comparable to
state-of-the-art hybrid techniques. We demonstrate in a broad range of
numerical simulations the applicability of our framework in near-term and early
fault-tolerant settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a 100-qubit example
that direct classical simulation of our approach enables the prediction of
ground and excited state properties of quantum systems using tensor network
techniques, which we recognize as a quantum-inspired classical approach.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 通过圆偏振微波选择性激发hBN中的硼空位自旋缺陷，提高了量子传感的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: hBN因其光学可寻址的自旋缺陷（如硼空位）成为量子传感的有力平台，但大超精细相互作用限制了其磁敏感性。

Method: 使用交叉形微波共振波导和RFSoC FPGA生成圆偏振微波，选择性激发硼空位自旋缺陷。

Result: 实验和计算证实了选择性自旋激发，并研究了磁场对自旋态选择性的影响。

Conclusion: 该技术通过更好的自旋态控制和低场磁敏感性，增强了hBN在量子传感中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising two-dimensional
platform for quantum sensing, due to its optically addressable spin defects,
such as the negatively charged boron vacancy ($V_{\text{B}}^-$). Despite hBN
being transferrable to close proximity to samples, spectral overlap of spin
transitions due to large hyperfine interactions has limited its magnetic
sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate spin-selective excitation of $V_{\text{B}}^-$
spin defects in hBN driven by circularly polarized microwave. Using a
cross-shaped microwave resonance waveguide, we superimpose two orthogonally
linearly polarized microwave shifted in phase from a RFSoC FPGA to generate
circularly polarized microwaves. This enables selective spin
$|0\rangle\rightarrow|-1\rangle$ or $|0\rangle\rightarrow|1\rangle$ excitation
of $V_{\text{B}}^-$ defects, as confirmed by optically detected magnetic
resonance experimentally and supported computationally. We also investigate the
influence of magnetic field on spin-state selectivity. Our technique enhances
the potential of hBN platform for quantum sensing through better spin state
control and magnetic sensitivity particularly at low fields.

### [9] [Faster Probabilistic Error Cancellation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04468)
*Yi-Hsiang Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率误差消除（PEC）方法，通过分解逆通道并重新组织电路，降低采样成本，同时控制偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准PEC方法采样开销大，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 分解逆通道为恒等和非恒等部分，重新组织电路为不同幂次的逆生成器，确定性地分配采样次数。

Result: 新方法在采样成本和偏差控制上优于标准PEC，实验验证了其准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限采样下实现可控偏差，适用于实际量子计算。

Abstract: Probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) is a leading quantum error mitigation
method that provides an unbiased estimate, although it is known to have a large
sampling overhead. In this work, we propose a new method to perform PEC, which
results in a lower sampling cost than the standard way. It works by decomposing
the inverse channel of each gate or each circuit layer into the identity part
and the non-identity part and reorganizing the full circuit as different powers
of the inverse generator. The ideal circuit becomes a linear combination of
noisy circuits with different weights where shots are deterministically
allocated to each circuit based on its weight. This naturally sets the
achievable bias given a finite amount of shots. As the number of shots is
increased, smaller bias terms can be gradually resolved and become bias-free in
the limit of sufficient shots. We show the saving both analytically and
numerically over the standard PEC and identify situations where it can
outperform heuristic approach, such as zero-noise extrapolation, due to the
well-controlled bias. We also demonstrated this method experimentally and found
excellent agreement between the mitigated and the ideal values.

Result: 深度学习模型在精度上与最小二乘法相当，但计算时间显著减少。单图像模型与多图像模型精度相似。

Conclusion: 单图像模型简化了实验设计和成像硬件要求，适用于单次曝光吸收成像。

Abstract: The quantum state of ultracold atoms is often determined through measurement
of the spatial distribution of the atom cloud. Absorption imaging of the cloud
is regularly used to extract this spatial information. Accurate determination
of the parameters which describe the spatial distribution of the cloud is
crucial to the success of many ultracold atom applications. In this work, we
present modified deep learning image classification models for image
regression. To overcome challenges in data collection, we train the model on
simulated absorption images. We compare the performance of the deep learning
models to least-squares techniques and show that the deep learning models
achieve accuracy similar to least-squares, while consuming significantly less
computation time. We compare the performance of models which take a single atom
image against models which use an atom image plus other images that contain
background information, and find that both models achieved similar accuracy.
The use of single image models will enable single-exposure absorption imaging,
which simplifies experiment design and eases imaging hardware requirements.

Conclusion: 研究扩展了量子纠错的基础，为噪声信道中的量子通信提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of state communication in finite-level
quantum systems through noise-affected channels. Our approach is based on a
self-consistent theory of decoding inner products associated with the code and
error (or noise) bases defined on corrupting subspaces. This viewpoint yields
new necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of quantum
error-correcting codes in terms of these inner products. The obtained results
extend the foundations of quantum error correction beyond classical analogies,
highlighting the structural insights offered by operator theory and the
underlying product space.

Conclusion: QIS3是一种鲁棒的高性能求解器，结合了经典精确策略和量子启发式方法，适用于可扩展的QUBO优化。

Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) provides a versatile
framework for representing NP-hard combinatorial problems, yet existing solvers
often face trade-offs among speed, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we
introduce a quantum-inspired solver (QIS) that unites branch-and-bound pruning,
continuous gradient-descent refinement, and quantum-inspired heuristics within
a fully adaptive control architecture. We benchmark QIS3 against eight
state-of-the-art solvers, including genetic algorithms, coherent Ising
machines, simulated bifurcation, parallel tempering, simulated annealing, our
prior QIS2 version, D-Wave's simulated-annealing (Neal), and Gurobi on three
canonical QUBO problem classes: Max-Cut, NAE-3SAT, and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
spin glass problems. Under a uniform runtime budget, QIS3 attains the best
solution on nearly all instances, achieving optimality in 94% of max-cut
instances. These results establish QIS3 as a robust, high-performance solver
that bridges classical exact strategies and quantum-inspired heuristics for
scalable QUBO optimization.

Conclusion: 该编译器为大规模量子计算提供了实用的硬件需求估算工具，促进了社区合作。

Abstract: The emerging field of quantum resource estimation is aimed at providing
estimates of the hardware requirements (`quantum resources') needed to execute
a useful, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Given that quantum computers are
intended to compete with supercomputers, useful quantum computations are likely
to involve the use of millions of qubits and error correction clock cycles. The
compilation and benchmarking of these circuits depends on placement and routing
algorithms, which are infeasible to construct at scale by hand. We offer a
compiler that transforms a quantum circuit into a sequence of lattice surgery
operations. The compiler manages memory in terms of surface code patches and
costs the space-time volume and cycle counts of the input circuits. These
compiled lattice surgery objects are then recursively repurposed as gates for
larger scale compilations. Our code is available on GitHub under a permissive
software license and we welcome community contributions.

Result: 对数负性和精确纠缠成本随系统体积增长，而纠缠形成、压缩纠缠等呈现次扩展性。

Conclusion: 纠缠度量的差异源于精确和渐近精确态制备的纠缠成本参数差异，与量子希尔伯特空间碎片化模式相关。

Abstract: Strong symmetries enforce non-trivial quantum entanglement patterns on the
stationary states of symmetric open quantum dynamics. Specifically,
non-commuting conserved quantities lead to long-range quantum entanglement even
for infinite temperature mixed states within fixed symmetry sectors. Leveraging
the commutant algebra framework, we show that various bipartite entanglement
measures for mixed states -- including exact and asymptotically-exact
entanglement costs and squashed entanglement, which are generally intractable
for a generic many-body mixed state -- can be computed for this class of
states. In particular, we focus on strongly symmetric maximally mixed states
arising from the Temperley-Lieb model, which features quantum Hilbert space
fragmentation with exponentially large (in system size) non-Abelian commutants.
We find that while both the logarithmic negativity and the `exact' entanglement
cost for equal-size bipartitions scale with the volume of the system, the
entanglement of formation, squashed entanglement, entanglement cost, and
distillable entanglement exhibit subextensive scaling. We relate this
separation in entanglement measures to a parametric difference between the
entanglement cost of exact and asymptotically-exact state preparations, and
infer this to be a consequence of a particular pattern of quantum Hilbert space
fragmentation.

Abstract: Various methods have been explored to prepare the spin-adapted ground state,
the lowest energy state within the Hilbert space constrained by externally
specified values of the total spin magnitude and the spin-$z$ component. In
such problem settings, variational and non-variational methods commonly
incorporate penalty terms into the original Hamiltonian to enforce the desired
constraints. While in variational approaches, only $O(n_{\textrm{spin}}^2)$
measurements are required for the calculation of the penalty terms for the
total spin magnitude, non-variational approaches, such as probabilistic
imaginary-time evolution or adiabatic time evolution, are expected to be more
computationally intensive, requiring $O(n_{\textrm{spin}}^4)$ gates naively.
This paper proposes a new procedure based on non-variational quantum algorithms
to obtain the spin-adapted ground state. The proposed method consists of two
steps: the first step is to prepare a spin-magnitude adapted state and the
second step is post-processing for the desired $S_z$. By separating into two
steps, the procedure achieves the desired spin-adapted ground state while
reducing the number of penalty terms from $O(n_{\textrm{spin}}^4)$ to
$O(n_{\textrm{spin}}^2)$. We conducted numerical experiments for spin-1/2
Heisenberg ring models and manganese trimer systems. The results confirmed the
effectiveness of our method, demonstrating a significant reduction in gate
complexity and validating its practical usefulness.

Abstract: Parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) are crucial in variational quantum
algorithms. While it is commonly believed that the optimal PQC is solely used
to reproduce the target state, we here reveal that the optimal PQC can also
provide valuable insights into the state's properties. We propose variational
toolboxes to identify the $k$-separability of pure states, with or without
preparation noise, by checking the structure within the optimal PQCs.
Additionally, we introduce adaptive optimization strategies to detect the
$k$-separability of mixed states. Compared to fixed PQCs, our approach controls
fewer parameters for low-rank states. Finally, we validate our methods through
numerical demonstrations for various states.

Abstract: Optimal routing problems of electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted much
attention in recent years, and installation of charging stations is an
important issue for EVs. Hence, we focus on the joint optimization of the
location of charging stations and the routing of EVs. When routing problems are
formulated in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO),
specialized solvers such as quantum annealer are expected to provide optimal
solutions with high speed and accuracy. However, battery capacity constraints
make it hard to formulate into QUBO form without a large number of auxiliary
qubits. Then, we propose a sequential optimization method utilizing the
Bayesian inference and QUBO solvers, in which method the battery capacity
constraints are automatically learned. This method enables us to optimize the
number and location of charging stations and the routing of EVs with a small
number of searches. Applying this method to a routing problem of 20 locations,
we confirmed that the learning process works well and efficient searches find
good solutions. This result enhances the possibility that the QUBO solver could
be applied to the constraints contained problems which is difficult to
formulate into QUBO form without a large number of ancilla qubits.

Abstract: Previously we found a unique quantum system with a positive gauge-invariant
Weyl-Stratonovich quasi-probability density function which can be defined by
the so-called {\guillemotleft}quadratic funnel{\guillemotright} potential
[Phys. Rev. A 110 02222 (2024)]. In this work we have constructed a class of
exact solutions to the 3D Schr\"odinger equation for a two-parameter
{\guillemotleft}quadratic funnel{\guillemotright} potential based on the -model
of micro and macro systems. Explicit expressions for the energy spectrum and
the set of eigenfunctions have been found. Using gauge invariance for scalar
and vector potentials, a solution to the electromagnetic Schr\"odinger equation
has been obtained, with a magnetic field in the form of a {\guillemotleft}Dirac
string{\guillemotright} defined by a singular vortex probability flux field.
Superpositions of eigenfunctions leading to various types of vortex and
potential probability current fields have been investigated in detail. The
analysis of the quantum system's properties has been carried out within the
Wigner-Vlasov formalism.

Abstract: Matterwaves made up of ultra-cold quantum-degenerate atoms have enabled the
creation of tools having unprecedented sensitivity and precision in measuring
gravity, rotation or magnetic fields. Applications range from gravitational
wave detection and tests of Einstein's equivalence principle to inertial
sensing for navigation and gravitational gradient sensing for oil and mineral
exploration. In this letter, we introduce atom-optics as a novel tool of
manipulating matterwaves in ring-shaped coherent waveguides. We collimate and
focus matterwaves derived from Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) and ultra-cold
thermal atoms in ring-shaped time-averaged adiabatic potentials. We demonstrate
`delta-kick cooling' of BECs, reducing their expansion energies by a factor of
34. The atomtronic waveguide ring has a radius of only $485\,\mu m$, compared
to other state-of-the-art experiments requiring zero gravity or chambers of ten
meter. This level of control with extremely reduced spatial requirements is an
important step towards atomtronic quantum sensors.

Abstract: Quantum technologies promise profound advances in communication security,
sensing and computing. The underpinning hardware must be engineered to
generate, manipulate and detect quantum phenomena with exceptional performance,
whilst being mass-manufacturable for real-world applications. A leading
approach is chip-scale quantum photonics. The continuous-variable regime for
quantum optics has been exploited in a number of technologies, including the
detection of gravitational waves, by operating below the standard quantum limit
of the light's shot noise. The availability of room-temperature, deterministic
sources and high efficiency detectors suitable for continuous-variable state
generation and measurement is a compelling motivation for this particular
paradigm. This review focusses on efforts to integrate sources and detectors of
continuous-variable light states into chip-scale photonic integrated circuits.

Abstract: Quantum-classical transitions have long attracted much attention. We study
such transitions in quantum spin-($j$,1/2) systems at thermal equilibrium.
Unlike previous papers, it is found that the threshold temperature of quantum
entanglement decreases with increasing spin $j$ and completely disappears in
the limit $j\to\infty$. In the ground state of systems with highly symmetric
interactions, the discord-type quantum correlations can exist even for
arbitrarily large spin. Such correlations turn out to be unstable and are
destroyed by small perturbations that violate the symmetry of the Hamiltonian.
The stable quantum correlations gradually degrade as the spin $j$ grows and
eventually vanish when the classical limit is reached.

Abstract: Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire
spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body
systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged
by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread,
destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system.
A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal
region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an
avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in
an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered
magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze
the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement
entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for
strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with
system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at
strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body
localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase
leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and
tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are
restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results
hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world
materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems
across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we
leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene
hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE)
and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties.
Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and
spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with
exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum
simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE
and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly
challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator
with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real
backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal
relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade
simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose
discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap
between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the
promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while
also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving
accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.

Abstract: Collective behaviour of the components of a quantum system can significantly
alter the rates of dynamical processes within the system. A paradigmatic
collective effect is superradiance, the enhancement in the rate that radiation
is emitted by a group of emitters relative to that emitted by independent
emitters. Less studied are collective effects in energy transport, notably
supertransfer, the enhancement of the rate of energy transfer from donors to
acceptors due to delocalised excitations. Despite its proposed significance in
photosynthesis, there has been no direct experimental detection of
supertransfer because, in biological or molecular systems, delocalisation
cannot be turned on and off to evaluate its effect on energy transfer. Here, we
show that supertransfer could be directly observed using a quantum device based
on a superconducting circuit. The programmability and control offered by an
engineered device would allow controllable delocalisation of quantum states,
giving full tunability over supertransfer. Our guidelines for engineering
supertransfer could inform the design of future quantum-enhanced light
harvesters.

Conclusion: 该方法为长距离设备无关应用提供了更实用的实现路径。

Abstract: Certifying genuine nonclassical correlations over long distances is crucial
for device-independent (DI) quantum information protocols. However, in photonic
platforms this remains technologically challenging due to photon loss, which
opens the detection-loophole, rendering violations increasingly difficult for
less efficient detectors. A well-known strategy to mitigate this involves using
non-maximally entangled states, which Eberhard showed can tolerate lower
detection efficiencies. However, existing proposals and demonstrations have
been limited to short distances, as their success rates scale linearly with
channel transmittance. Here, we propose a protocol to herald a tunable
entangled state between distant users that achieves a post-selection-free Bell
inequality violation at the Eberhard limit. We identify the loss independence
of the vacuum component amplitude of the prepared state as the source of this
enhancement. Notably, our scheme requires only quantum interference at a
central station, followed by the detection of a single photon, preserving the
optimal square-root scaling with channel transmittance. Our approach provides
greater loss-tolerance in entanglement distribution, bringing long-distance DI
applications closer to practical implementation.

Abstract: Parrondo's paradox, where the alternation of two losing strategies can
produce a winning outcome, has recently been demonstrated in continuous-time
quantum walks (CTQWs) through periodic defect modulation. We extend this
phenomenon to aperiodic protocols. We show that deterministic, non-repetitive
defect switching can enhance quantum spreading in CTQWs compared to the
defect-free case. Furthermore, we establish that the degree of this enhancement
is strongly influenced by the autocorrelation and persistence characteristics
of the applied aperiodic sequence. Our findings indicate that aperiodic defect
modulation reliably maintains Parrondo's effect and provides new ways to
control wavepacket properties in CTQWs.

Abstract: Quantum universal invariants of general N-beam Gaussian fields are
investigated from the point of view of fields' intensity moments. A method that
uniquely links these invariants, including the global and marginal fields'
purities, to intensity moments is suggested. Determination of these invariants
identifies the Gaussian states including their quantum correlations. In
particular, the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion is reformulated in terms
of quantum universal invariants, and consequently in terms of experimental
intensity moments, offering a practical tool for determining the entanglement
or separability of these states. The approach is experimentally demonstrated by
determining the invariants of noisy symmetric 3-beam Gaussian states using
photon-number-resolved measurements. Furthermore, their entanglement properties
are analyzed and characterized.

Abstract: Over the last two decades the cold-atom physics has matured from
proof-of-principle demonstrations to a versatile platform for precision
measurements and study of quantum phenomena. Ultra-cold atomic ensembles have
been used both for technological and fundamental science applications. To fully
exploit their potential, a precise measurement and control of the atom number
in the ensemble is crucial. We report on a precise, minimally-destructive
measurement technique that can be used to prepare an atomic ensemble with a
desired atom number. The measurement relies on the dispersive light-atom
interaction, thus it is expected to have a negligible effect on the ensemble
temperature and to induce minimal decoherence in the atomic quantum state. As a
result, it can be used to perform quantum-enhanced measurements and prepare the
atom-number state at the start of an interferometer sequence.

Abstract: We investigate the scattered field from $N$ identical two-level atoms
resonantly driven by a weak coherent field in a one-dimensional waveguide. For

progressively suppresses transmission while enhancing photon bunching.
Transmission becomes a superbunched $(N+1)$-photon scattering process that is
predominantly incoherent. Remarkably, we find that this transmission is only
possible through a process where all $N$ atoms are excited, enabling heralded
multi-photon state generation with applications in long-distance entanglement
and quantum metrology.

Abstract: Computational models typically assume that operations are applied in a fixed
sequential order. In recent years several works have looked at relaxing this
assumption, considering computations without any fixed causal structure and
showing that such ''causally indefinite'' computations can provide advantages
in various tasks. Recently, the quantum query complexity of Boolean functions
has been used as a tool to probe their computational power in a standard
complexity theoretic framework, but no separation in exact query complexity has
thus-far been found. In this paper, we investigate this problem starting with
the simpler and fully classical notion of deterministic query complexity of
Boolean functions, and using classical-deterministic processes -- which may
exhibit causal indefiniteness -- as a generalised computational framework. We
first show that the standard polynomial and certificate lower bounds of
deterministic query complexity also hold in such generalised models. Then, we
formulate a Boolean function for which causal indefiniteness permits a
reduction in query complexity and show that this advantage can be amplified
into a polynomial separation. Finally, with the insights gained in the
classical-deterministic setting, we give a Boolean function whose quantum query
complexity is reduced by causally indefinite computations.

Conclusion: 量子退火设备在神经网络训练中具有潜力，即使是中等规模的设备也能通过分层训练发挥作用。

Abstract: Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both
computational and energy resources. We demonstrate that quantum annealing
platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical
NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics
perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the
system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained
state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its
energy landscape--akin to cutting off the ever-regenerating heads of a dragon.
The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple
deep states (dragon heads to be cut). We found that this quantum-assisted
training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical
backpropagation methods, with a notably higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs.
0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent
quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue
that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by
being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.

by a time continuous semigroup of quantum channels (completely positive and
trace-preserving linear maps). Baumgartner and Narnhofer presented a general
decomposition of the underlying Hilbert space into a sum of invariant
subspaces, also called enclosures. We propose a new reading of this result,
inspired by the work of Carbone and Pautrat. In addition, we apply this
decomposition to a class of open quantum random walks and to quantum
trajectories, where we study its uniqueness.

Conclusion: 研究全面表征了强驱动引起的超导量子比特状态跃迁，为优化量子非破坏性测量提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Repeated quantum non-demolition measurement is a cornerstone of quantum error
correction protocols. In superconducting qubits, the speed of dispersive state
readout can be enhanced by increasing the power of the readout tone. However,
such an increase has been found to result in additional qubit state transitions
that violate the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement.
Recently, the readout of a transmon superconducting qubit was improved by using
a tone with frequency much larger than the qubit frequency. Here, we
experimentally identify the mechanisms of readout-induced transitions in this
regime. In the dominant mechanism, the energy of an incoming readout photon is
partially absorbed by the transmon and partially returned to the transmission
line as a photon with lower frequency. Other mechanisms involve the excitation
of unwanted package modes, decay via material defects, and, at higher qubit
frequencies, the activation of undesired resonances in the transmon spectrum.
Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of superconducting qubit
state transitions caused by a strong drive.

Abstract: The erasure of information is fundamentally an irreversible logical
operation, carrying profound consequences for the energetics of computation and
information processing. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic costs
associated with erasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we
analyze an arbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary
input-output systems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the
ground state. We focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced
dynamics~\textemdash~that is, the minimal thermodynamic work required to erase
the logical output of the gate for any logical input, assuming full access to
the ancilla but no access to any purifying reference of the logical input
state. We determine that this adversarial erasure cost is directly proportional
to the negative min-entropy of the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the
dynamical min-entropy a clear operational meaning. A key foundation of this
result is the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates
the decoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges
thermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum
computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决量子计算中纠缠门和读取的保真度与速度问题，提出了一种基于强耦合模式的超导量子比特设计。

Method: 采用双模式设计：一个用于数据存储，一个用于耦合。通过非线性耦合实现高速、高保真度的操作，同时最小化线性耦合对数据模式的干扰。

Result: 模拟结果显示，该架构实现了微波CZ门（保真度8.6×10^-5，17 ns）、低ZZ相互作用（<0.4 kHz），以及高保真读取（错误率1×10^-4，27 ns）。单量子比特门保真度低于1×10^-5。

Conclusion: 该架构仅需电容耦合即可实现高性能，为可扩展的容错量子计算机提供了有前景的构建模块。

Abstract: We present a superconducting qubit which consists of two strongly coupled
modes: one for data storage and one for coupling, allowing faster,
higher-fidelity entangling gates and readout. The use of a dedicated coupling
mode allows nonlinear couplings of several hundred MHz between the data mode
and other elements, with minimal linear coupling to the data mode. Including
decoherence, simulations show that this architecture enables microwave-only CZ
gates with an infidelity of $8.6\times10^{-5}$ in 17 ns and always-on ZZ
interaction less than 0.4 kHz. Numerical simulations also show readout with
state assignment error of $1\times10^{-4}$ in 27 ns (assuming quantum
efficiency $\eta=0.5$), Purcell-limited lifetime of 167 ms without a Purcell
filter, and a mechanism to suppress shot-noise dephasing
($1/\Gamma_{\phi}=15.8$ ms). Single-qubit gate infidelities are below
$1\times10^{-5}$ including decoherence. These beyond experimental
state-of-the-art gate and readout fidelities rely only on capacitive coupling
between arm qubits, making the arm qubit a promising scalable building block
for fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Result: 展示了如何通过非微扰性器件实现高阶多体相互作用，并提供了基于域壁缺陷的简单示例。

Conclusion: 非微扰性器件为量子硬件实现高阶项提供了一种新途径，未来可能在更复杂的系统中进一步扩展。

Abstract: Continuous-time quantum hardware implementations generally lack the native
capability to implement high-order terms that would facilitate efficient
compilation of quantum algorithms. This limitation has, in part, motivated the
development of perturbative gadgets -- multi-qubit constructions used to effect
a desired Hamiltonian using engineered low-energy subspaces of a larger system
constructed using simpler, usually two-body, primitives. In this work, we
demonstrate how a class of non-perturbative gadgets can produce high-order
multi-body interactions by taking advantage of the odd-even properties of
topological defect subspaces. The simplest example is based on domain-wall
defects forming an effective Ising spin-chain based on three-body coupling with
linear connectivity, alongside three-, or five-body driving terms depending on
the intended use. Although this will be the main focus of the paper due to
conceptual simplicity, there exist systems constructed with only two-body
couplings where the boundaries determine whether there are an odd or even
number of defects, namely ice-like systems which may yield more complex
gadget-like constructions.

Conclusion: 该研究为耦合谐振器的模式分析提供了更准确的理论框架，揭示了传统理论的局限性。

Abstract: We demonstrate the general failure of the famous concept of tight binding and
mode hybridization underlying modern theories of coupled open resonators. In
spite of sophisticated examples in the literature, successfully illustrating
these theories, the latter fail to describe any planar systems. This includes
the simplest possible case of two dielectric slabs placed next to each other or
separated by a distance, which is straightforward for verification, due to its
analytical solvability. We present a rigorous theory capable of calculating
correctly the eigenmodes of arbitrary three-dimensional dispersive coupled
resonators in terms of their individual modes, providing insight into the
proper mode hybridization and formation of bonding and antibonding supermodes.
Planar optical resonators, such as coupled slabs and Bragg-mirror
microcavities, are used for illustrative purposes as they allow precise and
reliable verification of the theory.

Abstract: We investigate the focusing characteristics of scalar and vector beams within
an atomic medium. An active-Raman-gain configuration is employed to achieve
significant Kerr nonlinearity in a four-state atomic system. The probe beams
can attain focusing within the medium through careful selection of input beam
intensities and the spatial profile of the control field. We analytically
derive the linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities for both scalar
and vector probe beams. Our observations indicate that, in addition to the
energy transfer from the control beam to the probe beam, the giant cross-Kerr
nonlinearity facilitates the focusing of the scalar probe beam into a
significantly smaller spot size. Conversely, the vector probe beams exhibit
gain-induced narrowing. Furthermore, we evaluate the state of polarization for
the vector beam at the minimum beam waist, observing a polarization rotation
and a change in ellipticity during propagation. Through the mechanism of
focusing, we achieve a reduced spot size for the probe beam, which may have
substantial implications for resolution enhancement in microscopy applications.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

Conclusion: 该框架首次为KernelSHAP提供理论保证，揭示了现有估计器之间的权衡，并通过实验证明了方法的优越性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

$\tau=37.9(9) \,\mu$s that allows visible Rabi oscillations and
resolved-sideband spectroscopy. Using a combination of coherent population

Abstract: Shaped free electron vortices (SEVs) have recently been studied using atomic
(1+2) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) by oppositely chirped
counterrotating circularly polarized (OC-CRCP) femtosecond laser pulses. By
transitioning from the perturbative to the non-perturbative REMPI regime, we
identify an adiabatic excitation mechanism in a resonant V-type three-level
system, termed V-RAP due to its similarities to rapid adiabatic passage (RAP).
Experimentally, we observe a pronounced change in the shape of the measured
three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution (3D PMD), which we trace
back to this mechanism via analytical calculations and numerical simulations of
the bound state and ionization dynamics. In V-RAP, the atom adiabatically
follows the OC-CRCP field, with the two excited states driven in anti-phase,
leading to an adiabatic cancellation of specific ionization pathways and
explaining the observed changes in the PMD. In the experiment, we combine
supercontinuum polarization pulse shaping to generate OC-CRCP femtosecond laser
pulses with velocity map imaging-based photoelectron tomography to reconstruct
the 3D PMD. The reconstructed PMDs are decomposed by 3D Fourier analysis into
SEVs of different rotational symmetry, revealing a significant enhancement of
the $c_6$-symmetric contribution, which is the signature of the V-RAP.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel $q$-$\hbar$ deformation of the Heisenberg
algebra, designed to unify and extend several existing $q$-deformed
formulations. Starting from the canonical Heisenberg algebra defined by the
commutation relation $[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar$ on a Hilbert space
\cite{Zettili2009}, we survey a variety of $q$-deformed structures previously
proposed by Wess \cite{Wess2000}, Schm\"udgen \cite{Schmudgen1999},
Wess--Schwenk \cite{Wess-Schwenk1992}, Gaddis \cite{Jasson-Gaddis2016}, and
others. These frameworks involve position, momentum, and auxiliary operators
that satisfy nontrivial commutation rules and algebraic relations incorporating
deformation parameters. Our new $q$-$\hbar$ Heisenberg algebra $\mathcal{H}_q$
is generated by elements $\hat{x}_\alpha$, $\hat{y}_\lambda$, and
$\hat{p}_\beta$ with $\alpha, \lambda, \beta \in \{1,2,3\}$, and is defined
through generalized commutation relations parameterized by real constants $n,
m, l$ and three dynamical functions $\Psi(q)$, $\Phi(q)$, and $\Pi(q)$
depending on the deformation parameter $q$ and the generators. By selecting
appropriate values for these parameters and functions, our framework recovers
several well-known algebras as special cases, including the classical
Heisenberg algebra for $q = 1$ and $\Psi = 1$, $\Phi = \Pi = 0$, and various
$q$-deformed algebras for $q \neq 1$. The algebraic consistency of these
generalizations is demonstrated through a series of explicit examples, and the
resulting structures are shown to align with quantum planes
\cite{Yuri-Manin2010} and enveloping algebras associated with Lie algebra
homomorphisms \cite{Reyes2014a}. This construction offers a flexible and
unified formalism for studying quantum deformations, with potential
applications in quantum mechanics, noncommutative geometry, and quantum group
theory.

Abstract: We develop an analytical approach to quantum Gaussian states in infinite-mode
representation of the Canonical Commutation Relations (CCR's), using Yosida
approximations to define integrability of possibly unbounded observables with
respect to a state $\rho$ ($\rho$-integrability). It turns out that all
elements of the commutative $*$-algebra generated by a possibly unbounded
$\rho$-integrable observable $A$, denoted by $\langle A\rangle$, are normal and
$\rho \, $-integrable. Besides, $\langle A\rangle$ can be endowed with the
well-defined norm $\|\cdot\|_\rho:= {\rm tr}\,(\rho |\cdot| )$. Our approach
allows us to rigorously establish fundamental properties and derive key
formulae for the mean value vector and the covariance operator. We additionally
show that the covariance operator $S$ of any Gaussian state is real, bounded,
positive, and invertible, with the property that $S-iJ\geq 0$, being $J$ the
multiplication operator by $-i$ on $\ell_2({\mathbb N})$.

Motivation: 传统张量网络在高维计算中成本过高，而神经网络优化困难。结合两者优势，提出perceptrain以解决这些问题。

Method: 构建基于perceptrain的变分多体态，结合局部优化、动态参数调整和压缩技术，通过VMC和GFMC方法验证。

Result: 在10×10横向场量子Ising模型中，实现了极高的基态能量精度（VMC 10^-5，GFMC 10^-6），且优化鲁棒。

Conclusion: perceptrain方法在量子多体态优化中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为量子计算提供了新工具。

Abstract: Deep neural networks can represent very different sorts of functions,
including complex quantum many-body states. Tensor networks can also represent
these states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can
be prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions. Here, we
propose a generalization of the perceptron - the perceptrain - which borrows
features from the two different formalisms. We construct variational many-body
ansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as
a neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks.
These include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix
renormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once;
the possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the
optimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a
structure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a
combination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo
(GFMC) on a $10\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long
range $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the
Rydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing. We consistently
find a very high relative accuracy for the ground state energy, around
$10^{-5}$ for VMC and $10^{-6}$ for GFMC in all regimes of parameters,
including in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition. We used very small
ranks ($\sim 2-5$) of perceptrains, as opposed to multiples of thousand used in
matrix product states. The optimization of the energy was robust with respect
to the choice of initial conditions and hyper-parameters, in contrast to a
common experience when using neural network wave functions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为“时间玻璃”的非周期性相，类似于离散时间晶体，存在于周期性驱动的耗散量子多体系统中，具有空间长程有序和时间混沌振荡的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究周期性驱动的耗散量子多体系统中非周期性相的存在及其特性，填补时间晶体研究的空白。

Method: 通过分析一周期（Floquet）Liouvillian算符的谱隙，结合数值模拟周期性驱动的耗散Ising模型，研究时间玻璃相的特性。

Result: 时间玻璃相中Liouvillian谱隙在热力学极限下保持有限，与时间晶体不同。谱隙与序参量自相关的经典动力学衰减率一致。

Conclusion: 时间玻璃相的存在揭示了微观谱特征与宏观动力学之间的直接联系，解决了有限谱隙与持久混沌振荡之间的矛盾。

Abstract: We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time
crystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body
systems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range
order arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii)
temporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges
with system size. To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the
spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay
rate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven
dissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian
gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals
where the gap closes exponentially with system size. We further demonstrate
that the Liouvillian gap converges to the decay rate of the order-parameter
autocorrelation derived from the classical (mean-field) dynamics in the
thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a direct correspondence between
microscopic spectral features and emergent macroscopic dynamics in driven
dissipative quantum systems. At first glance, the existence of a nonzero
Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the presence of indefinitely
persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing
that the quantum R\'enyi divergence between a localized coherent initial state
and the highly delocalized steady state grows unboundedly with system size.
This divergence allows long-lived transients to persist even in the presence of
a finite Liouvillian gap.

Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit dynamics characterized by alternating phases.
Describing the fluctuations of such systems over stochastic trajectories is
necessary across diverse fields, from biological motors to quantum thermal
machines. In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic
excursions -- a framework to analyze far from equilibrium processes via
sub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures
finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights
into thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest,
such as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance
this formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently
compute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit
formulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as
well as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion
statistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation
between fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the
steady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation
theorem for individual excursions. In addition, we explore how analyzing
excursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three
problems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular
sensing, and birth-and-death processes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Rosenzweig-Porter随机矩阵系综的谱和算子统计，以理解其在遍历、分形和局域化相中的行为差异，并验证自由概率理论在这些相中的适用性。

Method: 利用自由概率框架和微扰方案，结合数值模拟和解析近似，计算了态密度和高阶关联函数。通过统计工具（如χ²统计量、Kullback-Leibler散度和Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验）分析了算子统计。

Result: 在遍历相中，自由概率预测与数值结果高度一致；而在分形和局域化相中，存在持续偏差。分形相表现出部分渐近自由特性，但仍保留初始谱的记忆。定义了“自由时间”尺度，标志自由概率行为开始的时刻。

Conclusion: 自由概率理论在遍历相中有效，但在分形和局域化相中不完全适用。非局域化本征态对自由概率行为的出现至关重要。研究结果为理解复杂系统的统计行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and
operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which
exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized
regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme
that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second
order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute
higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical
and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for
various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free
probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent
deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times.
Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial features of asymptotic freeness
while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of
non-localized eigenstates for the emergence of free probability behavior.
Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$
statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis
testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the
onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral
statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate
consistency across these different approaches.

Abstract: We have re-analyzed the dynamics of the thermal potential within
Schwarzschild spacetime by employing the Fokker-Planck equation. We demonstrate
that the Fokker-Planck equation reduces to a simplified form equivalent to a
scaled quantum mechanical problem with a harmonic oscillator potential. In this
framework, we highlight an interesting correspondence between supersymmetric
quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) and the Fokker-Planck dynamics associated with the
Schwarzschild metric. Utilizing the isospectral deformation, an intrinsic
feature of SUSY QM, we derive a family of one-parameter isospectral potentials.
Notably, this new class of potentials exhibits the same energy spectrum as the
original harmonic oscillator potential, but with distinct wavefunctions.

Abstract: Trace-free Einstein gravity, in the absence of matter fields and using the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, is solvable both classically and
quantum mechanically. This is achieved by using the conformal time as the time
variable and the negative or positive of the inverse of the scale factor as
configuration variable to write the classical equation of motion, which turns
out to be the one of a free particle ($k=0$), a harmonic oscillator ($k=1$),
and a repulsive oscillator ($k=-1$) in the real half-line. In all cases, the
observable identified as the cosmological constant is six times the
Hamiltonian. In particular, for a closed Universe ($k=1$), spacetime exhibits a
cyclic evolution along which the scalar curvature is constant and finite,
thereby avoiding singularities. The quantum theory is reached by using
canonical quantization. We calculate the spectrum of the observable
corresponding to the cosmological constant. Remarkably, for the closed Universe
($k=1$), the spectrum is discrete and positive while for flat ($k=0$) and open
($k=-1$) universes, the spectra are continuous. Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle imposes limitations on the simultaneous measurement of the Hubble
expansion (momentum variable) and the configuration variable. We also report
the observable identified as the cosmological constant for inflaton, phantom
and perfect fluids coupled to trace-free Einstein gravity in the FRW metric.

Abstract: The inaugural edition of the MIT Quantum Index Report (QIR). Quantum
technologies are evolving from theoretical concepts into tangible technologies
with commercial promise. Their rapid progress is capturing global attention and
suggests we stand on the cusp of a second quantum revolution. Unlocking the
quantum opportunity is not simple. One challenge is that quantum technologies
can present a high barrier to understanding for nonexperts because they often
rely on complex principles and concepts from a variety of specialist fields.
This can lead to confusion and intimidation for business leaders, educators,
policymakers and others. The Quantum Index Report aims to reduce the complexity
and make it possible for a wider audience to have a deeper understanding of the
quantum landscape. The Quantum Index Report provides a comprehensive,
data-driven assessment of the state of quantum technologies. For this inaugural
edition we have focused on quantum computing and networking. The report tracks,
measures, and visualizes trends across research, development, education and
public acceptance. It aggregates data from academia, industry and policy
sources and aims to provide nonpartisan insights.

monotonically with indium concentration. The critical field of
superconductivity, however, does not follow the same behavior as critical
temperature with indium concentration and exhibits a carrier-density-dependent
violation of the Pauli limit. The electron-phonon coupling, from the McMillan
formula, exhibits a systematic enhancement with indium concentration,
suggesting a potential violation of BCS weak coupling at high indium
concentrations.

Abstract: We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum
materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the
itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it
effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the
curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation.
The emergent gravity gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of
the gravitational lensing. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational''
phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening
new research directions in quantum physics.

Abstract: Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can
theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting
non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. However, direct
experimental evidence has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit
framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic
signatures that clearly indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the
first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce
an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches
Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests as anomalous,
temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high
magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and
guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems.
Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum
information technologies without compromising coherence.

Abstract: Controlling the energy spectrum of quantum-coherent superconducting circuits,
i.e. the energies of excited states, the circuit anharmonicity and the states'
charge dispersion, is essential for designing performant qubits. This control
is usually achieved by adjusting the circuit's geometry. In-situ control is
traditionally obtained via an external magnetic field, in the case of tunnel
Josephson junctions. More recently, semiconductor-weak-links-based Josephson
junctions have emerged as an alternative building block with the advantage of
tunability via the electric-field effect. Gate-tunable Josephson junctions have
been succesfully integrated in superconducting circuits using for instance
semiconducting nanowires or two-dimensional electron gases. In this work we
demonstrate, in a graphene superconducting circuit, a large gate-tunability of
qubit properties: frequency, anharmonicity and charge dispersion. We
rationalize these features using a model considering the transmission of Cooper
pairs through Andreev bound states. Noticeably, we show that the high
transmission of Cooper pairs in such weak link strongly suppresses the charge
dispersion. Our work illustrates the potential for graphene-based qubits as
versatile building-blocks in advanced quantum circuits.

Abstract: Nanoporous graphene (NPG) has been fabricated by on-surface-self assembly in
the form of arrays of apporx. 1 nm-wide graphene nanoribbons connected via
molecular bridges in a two-dimensional crystal lattice. It is predicted that
NPG may, despite its molecular structure, work as electron waveguides that
display e.g. Talbot wave interference. Here, we demonstrate how the electronic
wave guidance may be controlled by the use of electrical fields transverse to
the ribbons; at low fields, point injected currents display spatially periodic
patterns along the ribbons, while high fields localize the injected current to
single ribbons. This behavior constitutes an electronic version of optical
breathing modes of Bloch oscillations, providing a simple mechanism for
controlling the current patterns down to the molecular scale. The robustness of
the self-repeating patterns under disorder demonstrate that the breathing modes
of single-ribbon injections offer exciting opportunities for applications in

Abstract: We construct a semiclassical theory for electrons in a non-Hermitian periodic
system subject to perturbations varying slowly in space and time. We derive the
energy of the wavepacket to first order in the gradients of the perturbations.
Applying the theory to the specific case of a uniform external magnetic field,
we obtain an expression for the orbital magnetization energy. Using the
principles of non-Hermitian dynamics, we define a physically meaningful
non-Hermitian generalization of the angular momentum operator and show that it
is compatible with the real part of the orbital magnetic moment. The imaginary
part of the orbital magnetic moment is also discussed and shown to originate
from an imaginary counterpart to the angular momentum that gives rise to a
non-Hermitian generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

Abstract: We investigate High-harmonic generation (HHG) in a dimerized Kitaev chain.
The dimerization in the model is introduced through a site-dependent modulating
potential, determined by a parameter $\lambda \in [-1:1]$. This parameter also
determines the strength of the hopping amplitudes and tunes the system's
topology. Depending upon the parameter $\lambda$, the HHG emission spectrum can
be classified into three segments. The first segment exhibits two plateau
structures, with the dominant one resulting from transitions to the chiral
partner state, consistent with quasiparticle behavior in the topological
superconducting phase. The second segment displays multiple plateaus, where
intermediate states enable various transition pathways to higher conduction
bands. Finally, the third segment presents broader plateaus, indicative of
active interband transitions. In the $\lambda\leq0$ regime, we observe the
mid-gap states (MGSs) hybridize with the bulk, suppressing the earlier observed
harmonic enhancements. This highlights the key role of the intermediate states,
particularly when MGSs are isolated. These results demonstrate that harmonic
emission profiles can be selectively controlled through the modulating
parameter $\lambda$, offering new prospects for tailoring HHG in topological
systems.
