### [1] [On whether quantum theory needs complex numbers: the foil theories perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08091)
*Yìlè Yīng,Maria Ciudad Alañón,Daniel Centeno,Jacopo Surace,Marina Maciel Ansanelli,Ruizhi Liu,David Schmid,Robert W. Spekkens*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过实验区分标准量子理论与实数振幅量子理论（RQT），并重新概念化了这两种理论的比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清Renou等人（2021）的研究争议，探讨量子理论是否需要复数表示，并研究如何通过实验区分标准量子理论与RQT。

Method: 将RQT重新定义为量子理论的子理论，通过时间反演对称性对称化，并与通过其他对称性对称化的子理论进行比较。

Result: 证明在仅依赖因果结构假设的情况下，无法区分任何“twirled量子世界”与标准量子理论，但可以区分RQT。

Conclusion: 通过对称化方法，揭示了因果结构在区分理论中的作用，并探讨了缺乏共享参考框架状态对区分可能性的影响。

Abstract: Recent work by Renou et al. (2021) has led to some controversy concerning the
question of whether quantum theory requires complex numbers for its
formulation. We promote the view that the main result of that work is best
understood not as a claim about the relative merits of different
representations of quantum theory, but rather as a claim about the possibility
of experimentally adjudicating between standard quantum theory and an
alternative theory -- a foil theory -- known as real-amplitude quantum theory
(RQT). In particular, the claim is that this adjudication can be achieved given
only an assumption about the causal structure of the experiment. Here, we aim
to shed some light on why this is possible, by reconceptualizing the comparison
of the two theories as an instance of a broader class of such theory
comparisons. By recasting RQT as the subtheory of quantum theory that arises by
symmetrizing with respect to the collective action of a time-reversal symmetry,
we can compare it to other subtheories that arise by symmetrization, but for
different symmetries. If the symmetry has a unitary representation, the
resulting foil theory is termed a twirled quantum world, and if it does not (as
is the case in RQT), the resulting foil theory is termed a swirled quantum
world. We show that, in contrast to RQT, there is no possibility of
distinguishing any twirled quantum world from quantum theory given only an
assumption about causal structure. We also define analogues of twirling and
swirling for an arbitrary generalized probabilistic theory and identify certain
necessary conditions on a causal structure for it to be able to support a
causal compatibility gap between the theory and its symmetrized version. We
draw out the implications of these analyses for the question of how a lack of a
shared reference frame state features into the possibility of such a gap.

### [2] [Kirkwood-Dirac Nonpositivity is a Necessary Resource for Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08092)

Conclusion: KD非正性是实现量子计算优势的关键资源。

Abstract: Classical computers can simulate models of quantum computation with
restricted input states. The identification of such states can sharpen the
boundary between quantum and classical computations. Previous works describe
simulable states of odd-dimensional systems. Here, we further our understanding
of systems of qubits. We do so by casting a real-quantum-bit model of
computation in terms of a Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution.
Algorithms, throughout which this distribution is a proper (positive)
probability distribution can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer.
We leverage recent results on the geometry of the set of KD-positive states to
construct previously unknown classically-simulable (bound) states. Finally, we
show that KD nonpositivity is a resource monotone for quantum computation,
establishing KD nonpositivity as a necessary resource for computational quantum
advantage.

Conclusion: 海森堡可分性是记忆效应的独立表征工具，需同时考虑两种绘景以全面描述量子非马尔可夫动力学。

Abstract: Divisibility of dynamical maps is a central notion in the study of quantum
non-Markovianity, providing a natural framework to characterize memory effects
via time-local master equations. In this work, we generalize the notion of
divisibility of quantum dynamical maps from the Schr\"odinger to the Heisenberg
picture. While the two pictures are equivalent at the level of physical
predictions, we show that the divisibility properties of the corresponding dual
maps are, in general, not equivalent. This inequivalence originates from the
distinction between left and right generators of time-local master equations,
which interchange roles under duality. We demonstrate that Schr\"odinger and
Heisenberg divisibility are distinct concepts by constructing explicit dynamics
divisible only in one picture. Furthermore, we introduce a quantifier for the
violation of Heisenberg P-divisibility, analogous to the trace-distance-based
measure of non-Markovianity, and provide it with an operational interpretation
in terms of the guessing probability between effects. Our results show that
Heisenberg divisibility is an independent witness of memory effects and
highlight the need to consider both pictures when characterizing non-Markovian
quantum dynamics.

Motivation: KD分布作为一种强大的拟概率框架，在量子信息处理中具有广泛应用，但缺乏实验上易于检测的非经典特征标准。

Method: 通过统计矩分析KD分布，提出了一种简单且适合实验实现的功能性评估标准。

Result: 该方法不仅能有效检测KD分布的非经典特征，还能扩展到识别其他量子资源。

Conclusion: 提出的标准为实验检测KD分布的非经典特征及其他量子资源提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution has recently emerged as a powerful
quasiprobability framework with wide-ranging applications in quantum
information processing tasks. In this work, we introduce an experimentally
motivated criterion for detecting nonclassical signatures of the KD
distribution using its statistical moments and demonstrate its effectiveness
through explicit examples. We further show that this approach extends naturally
to identifying other quantum resources, such as quantum coherence and
nonclassical extractable work -- that are intrinsically connected to the KD
distribution. Our criteria involves the evaluation of simple functionals,
making it well-suited for efficient experimental implementation.

Conclusion: 连续变量系统在网络量子关联中具有潜力，非高斯性是低压缩区域的重要资源。

Abstract: Quantum networks offer a compelling platform for probing nonlocal
correlations beyond the Bell scenario. While network nonlocality has been well
studied in discrete-variable (DV) systems, its exploration in
continuous-variable (CV) systems remains limited. In this work, we study the
bilocal scenario, the simplest quantum network, in a CV framework using
pseudospin measurements. We show that two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states
violate the bilocality inequality for any nonzero squeezing, with the violation
increasing monotonically and reaching the algebraic maximum in the infinite
squeezing limit. The robustness of this violation is explored in the presence
of local thermal noise. Next, we demonstrate nonbilocality in two key
non-Gaussian states, viz., the entangled coherent state and the CV Werner
state. Finally, we investigate the enhancement of nonbilocal correlations
through photon subtraction applied to the TMSV state. We show that a coherent
superposition of single-photon subtractions across modes enables maximal
bilocality violation even at zero squeezing, demonstrating non-Gaussianity as a
strong resource in the low-squeezing regime. Our findings underscore the
potential of CV systems for realizing network-based quantum correlations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究团队开发了一种多波谐振器，通过增加谐振器长度减少TLS引起的波动和噪声，显著降低了测量不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超导谐振器中TLS引起的损耗测量不准确的问题，尤其是低信噪比和TLS时间波动导致的30%以上的不确定性。

Method: 设计并制造了一种多波谐振器，将谐振器长度从标准的λ/4扩展到Nλ/4（N=37），通过空间平均和信噪比提升来减少TLS波动和测量不确定性。

Result: 多波谐振器将TLS波动的测量不确定性降低至5%，并验证了TLS引起的损耗在4GHz-6.5GHz范围内无频率依赖性。

Conclusion: 多波谐振器设计有效解决了TLS引起的损耗测量问题，为超导量子器件的进一步研究提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Two-level systems (TLS) are known to be a dominant source of dissipation and
decoherence in superconducting qubits. Superconducting resonators provide a
convenient way to study TLS-induced loss due to easier design and fabrication
in comparison to devices that include non-linear elements. However, accurately
measuring TLS-induced loss in a resonator in the quantum regime is challenging
due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the temporal fluctuations of the
TLS, leading to uncertainties of 30% or more. To address these limitations, we
develop a multi-wave resonator device that extends the resonator length from a
standard quarter-wave $\lambda/4$ to $N\lambda/4$ where $N = 37$ at 6GHz. This
design provides two key advantages: the TLS-induced fluctuations are reduced by
a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ due to spatial averaging over an increased number of
independent TLS, and the measurement SNR for a given intra-resonator energy
density improves by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$. The multi-wave resonator also has
fundamental and harmonic resonances that allow one to study the frequency
dependence of TLS-induced loss. In this work we fabricate both multi-wave and
quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators formed from thin-film aluminum on a
silicon substrate, and characterize their TLS properties at both 10mK and
200mK. Our results show that the power-dependent TLS-induced loss measured from
both types of resonators agree well, with the multi-wave resonators achieving a
five-fold reduction in measurement uncertainty due to TLS fluctuations, down to
5%. The $N\lambda/4$ resonator also provides a measure of the fully unsaturated
TLS-induced loss due to the improved measurement SNR at low intra-resonator
energy densities. Finally, measurements across seven harmonic resonances of the
$N\lambda/4$ resonator between 4GHz - 6.5GHz reveals no frequency dependence in
the TLS-induced loss over this range.

Abstract: This tutorial guides a competent programmer through the crafting of a quantum
circuit simulator from scratch, even for readers with almost no prior
experience in quantum computing. Open source simulators for quantum circuits
already exist, but a deeper understanding is gained by writing ones own. With
roughly 1000-2000 lines of code, one can simulate Hadamard, Pauli X, Y, Z,
SWAP, and other quantum logic gates, with arbitrary combinations of control and
anticontrol qubits, on circuits of up to 20+ qubits, with no special libraries,
on a personal computer. We explain key algorithms for a simulator, in
particular: qubit-wise multiplication for updating the state vector, and
partial trace for finding a reduced density matrix. We also discuss
optimizations, and how to compute qubit phase, purity, and other statistics. A
complete example implementation in JavaScript is available at
https://github.com/MJMcGuffin/muqcs.js , which also demonstrates how to compute
von Neumann entropy, concurrence (to quantify entanglement), and magic, while
remaining much smaller and easier to study than other popular software
packages.

### [8] [Quantum Resource Comparison for Two Leading Surface Code Lattice Surgery Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08182)
*Tyler LeBlond,Ryan S. Bennink*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究分析了哈密顿模拟在两种表面码编译方案下的资源成本，发现最优方案取决于模拟算法类型，建议编译器应根据逻辑电路特性动态选择方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索哈密顿模拟在量子计算中的资源优化，比较不同表面码编译方案对性能的影响。

Method: 分析两种表面码编译方案（序列化输入电路和直接编译）在哈密顿模拟中的资源成本，使用量子信号处理和Trotter-Suzuki算法进行测试。

Result: Trotterization算法通过直接编译显著提升性能，最优方案取决于模拟算法类型。

Conclusion: 建议量子计算机编译器根据逻辑电路特性动态选择最优编译方案，而非采用固定模式。

Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most promising candidates for the
demonstration of quantum advantage within the next ten years, and several
studies have proposed end-to-end resource estimates for executing such
algorithms on fault-tolerant quantum processors. Usually, these resource
estimates are based upon the assumption that quantum error correction is
implemented using the surface code, and that the best surface code compilation
scheme involves serializing input circuits by eliminating all Clifford gates.
This transformation is thought to make best use of the native multi-body
measurement (lattice surgery) instruction set available to surface codes. Some
work, however, has suggested that direct compilation from Clifford+T to lattice
surgery operations may be beneficial for circuits that have high degrees of
logical parallelism. In this study, we analyze the resource costs for
implementing Hamiltonian simulation using example approaches from each of these
leading surface code compilation families. The Hamiltonians whose dynamics we
consider are those of the transverse-field Ising model in several geometries,
the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the $\mathrm{\alpha-RuCl_3}$ complex under a
time-varying magnetic field. We show, among other things, that the optimal
scheme depends on whether Hamiltonian simulation is implemented using the
quantum signal processing or Trotter-Suzuki algorithms, with Trotterization
benefiting by orders of magnitude from direct Clifford+T compilation for these
applications. Our results suggest that surface code quantum computers should
not have a one-size-fits-all compilation scheme, but that smart compilers
should predict the optimal scheme based upon high-level quantities from logical
circuits such as average circuit density, numbers of logical qubits, and T
fraction.

Abstract: We study quantum enhancement of sensitivity using squeezed light in a
multi-parameter quantum sensor, the hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer
(hOPM) [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 034054, (2024)]. Using a single spin ensemble,
the hOPM acquires both the dc field strength (scalar magnetometry), and
resonantly detects one quadrature of the ac magnetic field at a chosen
frequency (rf magnetometry). In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer
(BBOPM) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the
hOPM is incomplete, leading to a complex interplay of the three quantum noise
sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and
measurement back-action noise. We observe these interactions using squeezed
light as a tool to control the distribution of optical quantum noise between
$S_2$ and $S_3$ polarization Stokes components, and the resulting effect on
readout quantum noise and measurement back-action.

Motivation: 探讨带符号动力学中时间方向的可检测性，以及与传统马尔可夫过程的区别。

Method: 假设动力学生成器为对称带符号拉普拉斯算子，并满足非递减Rényi-2熵的相空间第二定律，定义了一个测试时间方向的实验。

Result: 证明测试在时间间隔至少为τ时能正确识别时间方向，且在更短间隔内不会得出错误结论。还展示了一个无信号例子，其中τ为无穷大，时间箭头永久不可检测。

Conclusion: 带符号动力学可能导致时间箭头在初始区间内不可检测，量子可实现性值得进一步研究。

Abstract: We study how rapidly the direction of time becomes operationally detectable
from mesoscopic data when state-weights may be positive or negative. In
contrast with classical Markov processes -- where forward evolution is
instantly distinguishable from its reverse -- signed dynamics can render the
arrow of time undetectable during an initial interval. Assume the generator of
the signed dynamics is a symmetric signed Laplacian (with a single linear
invariant) and a phase-space Second Law holds in the form of non-decreasing
R\'enyi-$2$ entropy. Drawing on recent results on eventual exponential
positivity of signed Laplacians (Chen et al., 2021), we define a test that
correctly identifies the direction of thermodynamic time if conducted over a
time interval of length at least $\tau$. We go on to prove that the test cannot
deliver an incorrect conclusion if conducted over a shorter interval. Dropping
symmetry, we exhibit a no-signaling example where $\tau = +\infty$, so that the
arrow of time remains permanently undetectable under our test. We comment
briefly on quantum realizability of our framework.

Result: PRFT应用于两能级和四能级系统，显著提高了量子传感设备的灵敏度。

Conclusion: PRFT是一种灵活工具，可大幅提升光谱量子传感的灵敏度。

Abstract: Spectroscopic methods play a vital role in quantum sensing, which uses the
quantized nature of atoms or molecules to reach astonishing precision for
sensing of, e.g., electric or magnetic fields. In the theoretical treatment,
one typically invokes semiclassical methods to describe the light-matter
interaction between quantum emitters, e.g., atoms or molecules, and a strong
coherent laser field. However, these semiclassical approaches struggle to
predict the stochastic measurement fluctuations beyond the mean value,
necessary to predict the sensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing
protocols. Here, we develop a theoretical framework based on the recently
developed Photon-resolved Floquet theory (PRFT) which is capable to predict the
measurement statistics describing higher order statistics of coherent quantum
states of light. The PRFT constructs flow equations for the cumulants of the
photonic measurement statistics utilizing only the semiclassical dynamics of
the matter system. We apply the PRFT to spectroscopic quantum sensing using
dissipative two-level and four-level systems (describing electric field sensing
with Rydberg atoms), and demonstrate how to calculate the Fisher information of
the measurement statistics with respect to various system parameters. In doing
so, we demonstrate that the PRFT is a flexible tool allowing to improve the
sensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing devices by several orders of
magnitudes.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在表面码（距离7）下性能与经典最小权重完美匹配算法相当。

Conclusion: 传统解码任务可通过量子设备完成，无需经典设备，为自纠错量子计算机的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum computers require error correction to achieve universal quantum
computing. However, current decoding of quantum error-correcting codes relies
on classical computation, which is slower than quantum operations in
superconducting qubits. This discrepancy makes the practical implementation of
real-time quantum error correction challenging. In this work, we propose a
decoding scheme that leverages the operations of the quantum circuit itself.
Given a noisy quantum circuit $A$, we train a decoding quantum circuit $B$
using syndrome measurements to identify the logical operators needed to correct
errors in circuit $A$. The trained quantum circuit $B$ can be deployed on
quantum devices, such as superconducting qubits, to perform real-time decoding
and error correction. Our approach is applicable to general quantum codes with
multiple logical qubits and operates efficiently under various noise
conditions, and the decoding speed matches the speed of the quantum circuits
being corrected. We have conducted numerical experiments using surface codes up
to distance 7 under circuit-level noise, demonstrating performance on par with
the classical minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm. Interestingly, our
method reveals that the traditionally classical task of decoding
error-correcting codes can be accomplished without classical devices or
measurements. This insight paves the way for the development of self-correcting
quantum computers.

Abstract: Solving quantum many-body systems is one of the most significant regimes
where quantum computing applies. Currently, as a hardware-friendly
computational paradigms, variational algorithms are often used for finding the
ground energy of quantum many-body systems. However, running large-scale
variational algorithms is challenging, because of the noise as well as the
obstacle of barren plateaus. In this work, we propose the quantum version of
matrix product state (qMPS), and develop variational quantum algorithms to
prepare it in canonical forms, allowing to run the variational MPS method,
which is equivalent to the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method, on near
term quantum devices. Compared with widely used methods such as variational
quantum eigensolver, this method can greatly reduce the number of qubits used
in local optimization, and thus mitigate the effects of barren plateaus while
obtaining better accuracy. Our method holds promise for distributed quantum
computing, offering possibilities for fusion of different computing systems.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization
problems whose objective functions are represented by Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. For broader applicability of QA,
quadratization methods are used to transform higher-order problems into QUBOs.
However, quadratization methods for complex problems involving Machine Learning
(ML) remain largely unknown. In these problems, strong nonlinearity and dense
interactions prevent conventional methods from being applied. Therefore, we
model target functions by the sum of rectified linear unit bases, which not
only have the ability of universal approximation, but also have an equivalent
quadratic-polynomial representation. In this study, the proof of concept is
verified both numerically and analytically. In addition, by combining QA with
the proposed quadratization, we design a new black-box optimization scheme, in
which ML surrogate regressors are inputted to QA after the quadratization
process.

Abstract: Recent investigations suggest that the discrete linear unitary group $U(N)$
can be represented by interlacing a finite sequence of diagonal phase
operations with an intervening unitary operator. However, despite rigorous
numerical justifications, no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that
elements of $U(N)$ can be decomposed into a sequence of $N$-parameter phases
alternating with $1$-parameter propagators of a lattice Hamiltonian. The proof
is based on building a Lie group by alternating these two operators and showing
its completeness to represent $U(N)$ for a finite number of layers, which is
numerically found to be exactly $N$. This architecture can be implemented using
elementary optical components and can successfully reconstruct arbitrary
unitary matrices. We propose example devices such as optical logic gates, which
perform logic gate operations using a single-layer lossless and passive optical
circuit design.

Abstract: While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received
substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning,
their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this
interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as
function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results
quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which
explicitly depend on model parameters. Thus, they give rise to a
regularization-based training approach for robust and generalizable quantum
models, highlighting the importance of trainable data encoding strategies. The
practical implications of the theoretical results are demonstrated with an
application to time series analysis.

Abstract: Wave-particle duality, intertwining two inherently contradictory properties
of quantum systems, remains one of the most conceptually profound aspects of
quantum mechanics. By using the concept of energy capacity, the ability of a
quantum system to store and extract energy, we derive a device-independent
uncertainty relation for wave-particle duality. This relation is shown to be
independent of both the representation space and the measurement basis of the
quantum system. Furthermore, we experimentally validate this wave-particle
duality relation using a photon-based platform.

Abstract: A gradient-based optimization approach combined with automatic
differentiation is employed to ensure high accuracy and scalability when
working with high-dimensional parameter spaces. Numerical simulations confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed method: the population is reliably
transferred to the target state with minimal occupation of intermediate levels,
while the control pulses remain smooth and physically implementable. The
developed framework serves as a universal and experimentally applicable tool
for automated control pulse design in quantum systems. It is particularly
useful in scenarios where analytical methods or manual parameter tuning--such
as standard schemes like STIRAP--prove to be inefficient or inapplicable.

Abstract: Diagrammatic techniques simplify a weakly interacting many-body problem into
an effective few-quasiparticle problem within a system of interest (SOI). If
scattering events, mediated by a bath, between those quasiparticles can be
approximated as density-density interactions, the bath behaves like an
effective external potential. On the other hand, exchange interactions could
entangle those quasiparticles and the bath, leading to an open quantum system
that induces quantum decoherence and spectral broadening. We investigate the
renormalized interaction between the SOI and the bath, employing a projection
operator technique similar to the one used in the Nakajima-Zwanzig method. We
find that the frequency variation of this renormalized interaction is analogous
to the quasiparticle residue and provides a measure of the SOI-bath
separability that serves as the lower bound of the SOI-bath entanglement
entropy. In the weak-coupling regime and continuum limit, we demonstrate that
the degree of SOI-bath separability corresponds to the quasiparticle spectral
weight in the single-impurity Anderson model and find that the loss of quantum
information to the continuum of the bath can be understood as a decay process
where an initial single-impurity state escapes to a thermal bath. This work
provides a direction for connecting energy dissipation in quasiparticles
propagation to the loss of quantum information in open quantum systems.

Abstract: When a coherent electromagnetic wave passes through a 50:50 beam splitter
(BS), it is divided equally into two parts. However, the quantum noise
associated with the resulting coherent states, despite being reduced in
amplitude by half, remains fundamentally constrained by the quantum noise
limit, independent of the intensity. By placing a mirror at the unused input
port of the BS, a standing wave is formed in the vicinity of the mirror, which
influences the vacuum fluctuations of the coherent state at the BS output.
Using semi-classical and quantum mechanical approaches, we calculate the vacuum
fluctuations induced by the mirror and demonstrate that the vacuum noise
originating from the mirror side periodically reaches zero at the BS output.
Leveraging this effect, we show that the vacuum fluctuations of the light split
by the BS can be readily reduced below the quantum noise limit. Furthermore,
through feedback mechanisms, the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic
field at the other output port can also be suppressed below the quantum noise
limit. These findings provide a pivotal insight into the manipulation of
electromagnetic noise, with broad implications for all experiments involving
quantum noise control.

Abstract: The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen~(EPR) model is an analogous model of the
anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model or the equivalent quantum maximum-cut
problem, proposed by R. King two years ago. Adjacent qubits in the model prefer
symmetric EPR/Bell parings rather than the antisymmetric one, in order to
maximize the energy. Recently, two groups independently develop specific
algorithms for the highest-energy state with approximation ratio
$\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}\approx.809$, based on maximum fractional matchings. Here
we try to refine one of the two algorithms by devising
homogeneous/quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, with the aim to distribute
quantum entanglement as much as possible. For regular graphs $G_d$, we
immediately obtain increasing approximation ratios $r_d$ with
$r_2=\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{6}\approx.872$. For irregular graphs, we show such a
refinement could still guarantee nice performance if the fractional matchings
are chosen properly.

Abstract: The non-Hermitian edge burst is a phenomenon observed in non-Hermitian
quantum dynamics, characterized by a significant accumulation of loss at the
boundaries of a system. We present an example of the edge burst effect in a
lossy lattice with bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). By introducing a
weak coupling between two such non-Hermitian lattices, we demonstrate that the
system exhibits bipolar scale-free localization. Through an analysis of local
decay distributions and their sensitivity to system parameters, we confirm the
occurrence of the edge burst effect in the system displaying scale-free
localization. Our findings support the notion that the skin effect is not a
necessary condition for the edge burst effect.

with a controlled M$\o$lmer-S$\o$rensen operation on a three-ion chain,

which the control qubit was in one of its logical basis states, and not in

Finally, we discuss how our protocol generalizes to a broad class of unitary
operations and larger qubit systems, enabling a single-pulse implementation of

Abstract: High-fidelity multi-qubit initialization is vital for quantum simulation,
quantum information processing (QIP), and quantum sensing. In diamond
platforms, nuclear spin registers can be initialized through polarization
transfer from a nearby electronic spin whose high gyromagnetic ratio enables
efficient dynamical nuclear polarization (DNP). These hybrid systems are
typically controlled using diabatic spin rotations, which require precise
knowledge of all system parameters. Adiabatic DNP protocols on the other hand
have less strict requirements and could enable robust and high fidelity spin
transfer. However, due to the slow adiabatic sweeps and limited electron spin
coherence times, this approach has remained inaccessible. Here, we demonstrate
adiabatic pulsed nuclear spin polarization at room temperature in diamond. We
achieve enhanced polarization efficiency, a broad resonance window, and
improved tolerance to hyperfine coupling uncertainties relative to conventional
diabatic pulsed protocols. We also show how this approach can benefit the
initialization of spin clusters. These results set the scene for enhanced qubit
initialization in solid state through adiabatic pulsed driving, with
applications in solid-state quantum sensor and quantum memory technologies.

Conclusion: 自适应方法能够可靠地模拟高表达能力的变分量子态。

Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo
(tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational
quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses
numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is
overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the
concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between
variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each
parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already
computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the
selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step,
while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on
quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both
spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis
on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves
numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling
reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to
the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.
Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously
output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in
an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum
excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the
states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,
through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all
interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing
multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,
we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting
trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying
all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited
states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,
which closely match recent experimental observations that the
quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical
ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law
decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap
scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and
efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum
many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking
quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Abstract: We establish and analyse the performance and resource requirements of an
end-to-end fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing the absorption
spectrum and population dynamics of photoexcited pyrazine. The quantum circuit
construction consists of initial state preparation using uniformly controlled
rotations, the time-dependent Hamiltonian propagation based on the grid-based
Split Operator Quantum Fourier Transform (SO-QFT) method, and cost-effective
measurements including statistical and canonical phase estimation. We use
classical emulations to validate the quantum resources required for the task,
and propose generalised formulae for the qubit count and gate depth
calculation. Simulating the vibronic dynamics of pyrazine in a low-dimensional
abstraction requires 17-qubit circuits with a gate depth of
$\mathcal{O}(10^4)$, whereas a full-dimensional simulation of pyrazine in 24
modes requires at least 97-qubit circuits with a gate depth of
$\mathcal{O}(10^5)$. Our work provides a foundational framework for
understanding high-dimensional wavepacket-based quantum simulations of
photo-induced dynamics and vibronic spectra, anticipating future applications
in the simulation of even larger molecular systems on fault-tolerant quantum

Abstract: We Trotterize the mean-field dynamics of the integrable BCS model using
symplectic integrators. The resulting chaotic dynamics is characterized by its
Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers
depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition
at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly
chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization
steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different
scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum
Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large $\tau$ limit agrees well
with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current
quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables
like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description --
across the Trotter transition we uncover.

Abstract: Power broadening refers to the widening of the spectral line profile in a
two-state quantum transition as the strength of the driving field increases.
This phenomenon commonly arises in continuous-wave driving when the radiation
field's intensity exceeds the transition's saturation intensity and it has been
extensively studied in spectroscopy. For pulsed-field excitation, the spectral
response of the quantum system may differ significantly: while a
rectangular-shaped pulse leads to a linear power broadening, pulses with smooth
shapes show significantly reduced power broadening, for instance, logarithmic
for the Gaussian shape and none for the hyperbolic-secant shape. Recently
[Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{132}, 020802 (2024)], in a dramatic paradigm shift,
we have demonstrated experimentally that for Lorentzian-shaped pulses, the
opposite effect -- power narrowing -- takes place: the width of the spectral
profile decreases when the driving pulse amplitude increases, with a narrowing
factor of as much as 10 observed.
  While in high-resolution spectroscopy the push is for eliminating or even
inverting the power broadening, there are applications where it is used to an
advantage for it facilitates off-resonance excitation. Here, we present a
number of shaped pulses that exhibit power broadening much greater than that of
the rectangular pulse of the same pulse area. They are grouped in two families
of pulse shapes. In particular, in regard to the width of the second Rabi
oscillation maximum, the quadratic pulse family shows an increase by a factor
of 3.3 whereas the even-exponent pulse family exhibits an increase by a factor
of more than 3.5.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data
analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and
shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit
expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear
architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised
quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum
random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed
parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised
sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions
through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic
description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are
trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden
representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical
experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a
two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error
by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline;
on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a
quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance
three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as
a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum
circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.

Abstract: Toroidal microwave cavities are investigated for potential use in quantum
information storage and computation. Since exact analytical results are not
available for this geometry, extensive numerical simulation has been used to
develop a universal phenomenological model ("spectral flow diagram"). This
model is needed to guide the non-trivial design of toroidal resonators. A host
of new modes that do not exist in cylindrical cavities are classified,
including novel counter-intuitive ground states, and "dark nodal modes" that
are decoupled from the environment in the absence of antennae. Numerical
results are found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The existence
of dark nodal modes in a shallow smooth cavity geometry that offers easy access
for high quality surface treatment, suggests that high-Q toroidal cavities may
be exploited for long-term storage of quantum information used in quantum
processors.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for
Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce
the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While
large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical
quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as
passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many
applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic
threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently
been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel,
realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility
of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study
different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum
Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token
distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we
eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show
that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila
256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as
"Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".

Conclusion: 研究为任意子系统中纠缠与非定域性的关系提供了新见解。

Abstract: Standard quantum information theory is founded on the assumption that
multi-party state space possesses a tensor product structure. Anyons, as
quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems, exhibit unique entanglement
properties that differ from the conventional quantum systems, resulting from
the absence of a tensor product structure in their state spaces. This motivates
us to investigate the relationship between Bell nonlocality and entanglement in
anyonic states. Specifically, we find that certain pure anyonic states with
non-zero anyonic entanglement entropy (AEE) are local, yet exhibit nonlocality
when subjected to collective measurements on multiple copies--a phenomenon
known as superactivation of nonlocality, which is typically observed in
conventional mixed states. To analyze this, we decompose the total entanglement
of anyonic states into two components: one from the tensor product structure
and the other representing residual contributions. By studying their asymptotic
behavior, we find that the former gradually increases and approaches the AEE
while the latter diminishes with the number of copies. Crucially, the
entanglement component associated with the tensor product structure
demonstrates a significant correlation with nonlocality, which explains the
observed superactivation of nonlocality. Our findings provide new insights into
the connection between entanglement and nonlocality in anyonic systems.

Abstract: Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) and Quantum Random
Number Generation (CV-QRNG) are critical technologies for secure communication
and high-speed randomness generation, exploiting shot-noise-limited coherent
detection for their operation. Integrated photonic solutions are key to
advancing these protocols, as they enable compact, scalable, and efficient
system implementations. In this work, we introduce Femtosecond Laser
Micromachining (FLM) on borosilicate glass as a novel platform for producing
Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) realizing coherent detection suitable for
quantum information processing. We exploit the specific features of FLM to
produce a PIC designed for CV-QKD and CV-QRNG applications. The PIC features
fully adjustable optical components that achieve precise calibration and
reliable operation under protocol-defined conditions. The device exhibits low
insertion losses ($\leq 1.28$ dB), polarization-insensitive operation, and a
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) exceeding 73 dB. These characteristics
allowed the experimental realization of a source-device-independent CV-QRNG
with a secure generation rate of 42.74 Gbps and a QPSK-based CV-QKD system
achieving a secret key rate of 3.2 Mbit/s. Our results highlight the potential
of FLM technology as an integrated photonic platform, paving the way for

Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) have demonstrated a strong
potential in addressing graph-based optimization problems. However, the
execution of large-scale quantum circuits remains constrained by the
limitations of current quantum hardware. In this work, we introduce QuantCut,
an automatic framework for circuit cutting that enables efficient execution of
large quantum circuits by decomposing entangling two-qubit gates into
manageable sub-circuits. Specifically, we focus on gate-cutting techniques. We
apply QuantCut to a 71-qubit QAOA circuit ansatz for portfolio diversification
in the S&P 500 stock market, aiming to maximize asset diversification. Our
approach iteratively optimizes the expectation value while leveraging
circuit-cutting strategies to reduce the qubit register size. To validate our
framework, we first conduct experiments on a toy model using quantum noise
simulations for the Max-Cut problem, analyzing performance improvements with an
increasing number of layers. Subsequently, we extend our methodology to a
real-world financial optimization scenario, showing competitive results. The
results suggest that QuantCut effectively facilitates large-scale quantum
computations with circuit-cutting technologies.

Abstract: Time-bin encoding of quantum information is highly advantageous for
long-distance quantum communication protocols over optical fibres due to its
inherent robustness in the channel and the possibility of generating
high-dimensional quantum states. The most common implementation of time-bin
quantum states using unbalanced interferometers presents challenges in terms of
stability and flexibility of operation. In particular, a limited number of
states can be generated without modifying the optical scheme. Here we present
the implementation of a fully controllable arbitrary time-bin quantum state
encoder, which is easily scalable to arbitrary dimensions and time-bin widths.
The encoder presents high stability and low quantum bit error rate QBER, even
at high speeds of operation. Additionally, we demonstrate phase randomization

Conclusion: 多量子比特门在量子纠错中具有显著优势，为表面码纠错提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is one of the crucial building blocks for
developing quantum computers that have significant potential for reaching a
quantum advantage in applications. Prominent candidates for QEC are stabilizer
codes for which periodic readout of stabilizer operators is typically
implemented via successive two-qubit entangling gates, and is repeated many
times during a computation. To improve QEC performance, it is thus beneficial
to make the stabilizer readout faster and less prone to
fault-tolerance-breaking errors. Here we design a 3-qubit CZZ gate for
superconducting transmon qubits that maps the parity of two data qubits onto
one measurement qubit in a single step. We find that the gate can be executed
in a duration of $35\,$ns with a fidelity of F$=99.96 \, \%$. To optimize the
gate, we use an error model obtained from the microscopic gate simulation to
systematically suppress Pauli errors that are particularly harmful to the QEC
protocol. Using this error model, we investigate the implementation of this
3-qubit gate in a surface code syndrome readout schedule. We find that for the
rotated surface code, the implementation of CZZ gates increases the error
threshold by nearly 50\% to $\approx 1.2\,\%$ and decreases the logical error
rate, in the experimental relevant regime, by up to one order of magnitude,
compared to the standard CZ readout protocol. We also show that for the
unrotated surface code, strictly fault-tolerant readout schedules can be found.
This opens a new perspective for below-threshold surface-code error correction,
where it can be advantageous to use multi-qubit gates instead of two-qubit
gates to obtain a better QEC performance.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is considered a deciding component in enabling
practical quantum computing. Stabilizer codes, and in particular topological
surface codes, are promising candidates for implementing QEC by redundantly
encoding quantum information. While it is widely believed that a strictly
fault-tolerant protocol can only be implemented using single- and two-qubit
gates, several quantum computing platforms, based on trapped ions, neutral
atoms and also superconducting qubits support native multi-qubit operations,
e.g. using multi-ion entangling gates, Rydberg blockade or parallelized tunable
couplers, respectively. In this work, we show that stabilizer measurement
circuits for unrotated surface codes can be fault-tolerant using single
auxiliary qubits and three-qubit gates. These gates enable lower-depth circuits
leading to fewer fault locations and potentially shorter QEC cycle times.
Concretely, we find that in an optimistic parameter regime where fidelities of
three-qubit gates are the same as those of two-qubit gates, the logical error
rate can be up to one order of magnitude lower and the threshold can be
significantly higher, increasing from $\approx 0.76 \%$ to $\approx 1.05 \%$.
Our results, which are applicable to a wide range of platforms, thereby
motivate further investigation into multi-qubit gates as components for
fault-tolerant QEC, as they can lead to substantial advantages in terms of time
and physical qubit resources required to reach a target logical error rate.

Method: 分析了稀疏SYK模型（$p \in [\Theta(1/n^3),1]$），证明了Hastings--O'Donnell量子算法在$p\geq\Omega(\log n/n)$时仍有效，并展示了高斯态的局限性。

Conclusion: 稀疏SYK模型中，当$p\geq\Omega(\log n/n)$时，量子算法优于经典方法，扩展了Hastings--O'Donnell的结论。

Abstract: Finding the ground state of strongly-interacting fermionic systems is often
the prerequisite for fully understanding both quantum chemistry and condensed
matter systems. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a representative example
of such a system; it is particularly interesting not only due to the existence
of efficient quantum algorithms preparing approximations to the ground state
such as Hastings--O'Donnell (STOC 2022), but also known no-go results for many
classical ansatzes in preparing low-energy states. However, this
quantum-classical separation is known to \emph{not} persist when the SYK model
is sufficiently sparsified, i.e., when terms in the model are discarded with
probability $1-p$, where $p=\Theta(1/n^3)$ and $n$ is the system size. This
raises the question of how robust the quantum and classical complexities of the
SYK model are to sparsification.
  In this work we initiate the study of the sparse SYK model where $p \in
[\Theta(1/n^3),1]$. We show there indeed exists a certain robustness of
sparsification. First, we prove that the quantum algorithm of
Hastings--O'Donnell for $p=1$ still achieves a constant-factor approximation to
the ground energy when $p\geq\Omega(\log n/n)$. Additionally, we prove that
with high probability, Gaussian states cannot achieve better than a
$O(\sqrt{\log n/pn})$-factor approximation to the true ground state energy of
sparse SYK. This is done through a general classical circuit complexity
lower-bound of $\Omega(pn^3)$ for any quantum state achieving a constant-factor
approximation. Combined, these show a provable separation between classical
algorithms outputting Gaussian states and efficient quantum algorithms for the
goal of finding approximate sparse SYK ground states when $p \geq \Omega(\log
n/n)$, extending the analogous $p=1$ result of Hastings--O'Donnell.

Abstract: Topological quantum computation, featuring qubits built out of anyonic
excitations known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs), have long presented an
exciting pathway towards scalable quantum computation. Recently, the advent of
altermagnetic materials has presented a new pathway towards localized MZMs on
the boundary of two-dimensional materials, consisting of an altermagnetic film,
subject to a superconducting proximity effect from a superconducting substrate.
In this work, we demonstrate the possibility for an altermagnet-superconductor
heterostructure, to not only harbor MZMs, but also freely manipulate their
position along the topological boundary of the material, via rotation of the
N\'eel vector. Using this mechanism, on a square platform, we utilize a
time-dependent method to simulate the Z-gate via braiding, and then extend this
to a larger H-junction, where we implement the $\sqrt{X}$ and $\sqrt{Z}$ gate
on a single-qubit system. Further, this structure is eminently scalable to
many-qubit systems, thus providing the essential ingredients towards universal
quantum computation.

Abstract: Quasi-particle dynamics in interacting systems in the presence of disorder
challenges the notion of internal thermalization, but proves difficult to
investigate theoretically for large particle numbers. Engineered quantum
systems may offer a viable alternative, as witnessed in experimental
demonstrations in a variety of physical platforms, each with its own
capabilities and limitations. Semiconductor gate-defined quantum dot arrays are
of particular interest since they offer both a direct mapping of their
Hamiltonian to Fermi-Hubbard and Heisenberg models and the in-situ tunability
of (magnetic) interactions and onsite potentials. In this work, we use an array
of germanium quantum dots to simulate the dynamics of both single-spin
excitations (magnons) and two-spin excitations (triplons). We develop a
methodology that combines digital spin qubit operations for state preparation
and readout with analog evolution under the full system Hamiltonian. Using
these techniques, we can reconstruct quantum walk plots for both magnons and
triplons, and for various configurations of Heisenberg exchange couplings. We
furthermore explore the effect of single-site disorder and its impact on the
propagation of spin excitations. The obtained results can provide a basis for
simulating disorder-based solid-state phenomena such as many-body localization.

Abstract: In this study, the non-Hermitian scattering of gravitational waves is
examined, and their behavior at spectral singularities is discussed. We
investigate the non-Hermitian properties of gravitational waves through the
construction of a transfer matrix. By examining spectral singularity points
obtained from the transfer matrix, we explore the behavior of gravitational
waves at these spectral singularity points and compare the theoretical results
with observed measurements. Our findings demonstrate that the frequency values
of gravitational waves measured on Earth at spectral singularity points exhibit
perfect agreement with the corresponding Hubble constant values. This alignment
underscores the significance of the non-Hermitian characteristics of
gravitational waves. We anticipate that this research will contribute to a
deeper understanding of the role of non-Hermitian phenomena in gravitational
physics and provide a foundation for future studies in the field.

### [48] [Krylov Complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac Field Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08765)
*Hamid R. Imani,K. Babaei Velni,M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar*

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Lifshitz标度对量子系统中算子增长和信息传播的影响。

Method: 通过计算Lanczos系数，分析Krylov复杂度的增长和饱和行为，并比较连续和离散模型。

Result: 连续模型中Krylov复杂度呈指数增长后线性饱和，离散模型则因有限Krylov基而直接饱和。

Conclusion: Lifshitz标度显著影响算子增长和信息传播，离散与连续模型存在本质差异。

Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a
generic dynamical critical exponent z. By computing the Lanczos coefficients
for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior
of K-complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and
investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental
differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV
cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a
linear regime, with saturation values dictated by the cutoff scale. For the
lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to
the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing
indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator
growth and information spreading in quantum systems.

Abstract: Exploring strongly correlated spinful states of few fermionic ultracold atoms
in a rapidly rotating trap, an example of which was recently realized for two
fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an optical tweezer, we derive analytical (algebraic)
total-spin-eigenstate wavefunctions through the development and employment of a
theoretical platform that integrates exact numerical diagonalization (full
configuration interaction, FCI) with symbolic language processing. For such
rapid rotations, where the atoms occupy the lowest Landau level (LLL), the
obtained algebraic expressions can address the full LLL spectrum in all its
complexity, demonstrating that their spatial, spectral, and spin
characteristics manifest formation of collectively rotating and vibrating
Wigner molecules. The explicitly exhibited analytic wavefunctions (for two and
three spinful $^6$Li atoms) reproduce precisely the corresponding numerical FCI
results, and they are shown to reach beyond the limited range of applicability
of previous Jastrow-type treatments. These results, and their extension to
bosonic systems, provide the impetus and analysis tools for future experimental
and theoretical simulations of larger mesoscopic systems

Conclusion: 研究为高阶怪波的生成和控制提供了新的理论支持和方法。

Abstract: The collision dynamics of two first-order rogue waves (RWs) with opposite
incident momentum in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) is studied
by solving the two-component one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. It
is demonstrated that the introduction of appropriate incident momentum
successfully promotes the generation of second-order RWs in the case of
relatively weaker interspecies interactions compared to intraspecific
interactions. The range of incident momentum that can facilitate the generation
of second-order RWs under different interspecies interaction strengths is
determined, and machine learning is employed to find and analyze relationships
among the interspecies interaction, the incident momentum, and the offset that
can lead to the generation of second-order RWs. It shows that any two
parameters above exhibit a positive or negative correlation when the third
parameter is fixed. These findings provide additional possibilities for
generating and controlling high-order RWs.

Result: 发现临界Zeeman场下量子液滴的形成增强超辐射，气-液相变导致腔场突变，液滴相中腔场与泵浦强度呈线性关系。

Conclusion: 这些现象揭示了Zeeman场、腔辅助自旋混合和量子涨落的相互作用，为气-液相变提供了显著信号。

Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate,
where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by
cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity
becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the
enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum
droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above
the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the
system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of
the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt
jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed
density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear
scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as
prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and
coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted
spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.

Result: 证明了量子RM码在Pauli噪声信道中的速率最优性能，展示了其在不同信道参数下的通用性。

Conclusion: 量子RM码具有广泛的适用性和性能优势，适用于多种通信场景。

Abstract: Reed-Muller (RM) codes have undergone significant analytical advancements
over the past decade, particularly for binary memoryless symmetric (BMS)
channels. We extend the scope of RM codes development and analysis to
multiple-access channels (MACs) and quantum Pauli channels, leveraging a
unified approach. Specifically, we first derive the achievable rate region for
RM codes on so-called Q-MACs, a class of MACs with additive correlated noise.
This is achieved via a generalization of the bending and boosting arguments
defined in arXiv:2304.02509. We then put forward a connection between the rate
region of these QMACs and quantum RM codes designed for Pauli noise channels.
This connection highlights a universality property of quantum RM codes,
demonstrating their rate-optimal performance across a range of channel
parameters, rather than for a single Pauli channel.

Conclusion: 该理论为宏观测量提供了一种新的波函数坍缩机制，兼具理论一致性和实验可行性。

Abstract: We propose an extension of Schr\"odinger's equation that incorporates the
macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach
relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse
theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely,
the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long
as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the
localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on
average, the usual Schr\"odinger-like time evolution results. However, when the
wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a
macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe,
and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic
systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We
illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.

Abstract: Conventional superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) Josephson
junctions, devices where two superconductors are separated by a tunnel barrier
are technologically important as elements in quantum circuits, particularly
with their key role in superconducting qubits. An important characteristic of
Josephson junctions is the relation between the supercurrent Is and the phase
difference {\phi} between them. For SIS junctions, the current-phase relation
is sinusioidal and 2{\pi} periodic. Other types of Josephson junctions, where
the material between the superconductors is a weak link or a normal metal (N)
may have non-sinusoidal current-phase relations that are still 2{\pi} periodic.
We show here that a multi-terminal diffusive SNS Josephson junction with 4
superconducting contacts can show a current phase relation between two of the
contacts that is a superposition of 2{\pi} and 4{\pi} periodic components whose
relative strength is controlled by the phase difference between the other two
contacts, becoming 2{\pi} or 4{\pi} periodic for certain values of this phase
difference. This tunability might have applications in tailoring the
Hamiltonians of superconducting quantum circuits.

Conclusion: 该方法在交换势计算中表现出优越性，特别是在长程行为上，为原子、分子和固体的电子结构研究提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: In this work we describe a model for the exchange interaction of electrons,
as it follows from the Pauli exclusion principle. Starting from Hartree-Fock
theory and making use of the free electron-gas model we propose a simple scheme
to calculate the exchange-potential for atoms as well as simple molecules and
solids. This method assures the correct asymptotic long-range behavior of the
potential, contrary to local-density approximations that rely on a strongly
simplified generalization of the well-known Kohn-Sham or Slater exchange
interaction. Furthermore, our results approach the Kohn-Sham results in the
interstitial space of solids. As a benchmark test, total energies and
eigenenergies for atoms from He to Xe computed within our model are compared to
other calculations as well as to experimental data.

Conclusion: 自旋3/2重子散射中，纠缠功率与对称性密切相关，量子统计限制了对称性增强的条件。

Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics
and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving
the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional
qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under
the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered
indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the
spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we
study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement
power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix
is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or
non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in
spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the
entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics,
which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or
antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When
the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum,
enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an
Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by
quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles,
we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the
Identity gate.

Result: 提供了一种严格的框架，可以修正零阶相空间电子态，从而证明相空间电子结构方法的合理性。

Conclusion: 虽然无法定义“最优”相空间电子哈密顿量，但本文通过微扰理论为相空间方法提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a push to go beyond Born-Oppenheimer theory
and build electronic states from a phase space perspective, i.e. parameterize
electronic states by both nuclear position(R) and nuclear momentum(P). Previous
empirical studies have demonstrated that such approaches can yield improved
single-surface observables, including vibrational energies, electronic momenta,
and vibrational circular dichroism spectra. That being said, unlike the case of
BO theory, there is no unique phase space electronic Hamiltonian, nor any
theory for using phase space eigenvectors (as opposed to BO eigenvectors) so as
to recover exact quantum vibrational eigenvalues. As such, one might consider
such phase space approaches ad hoc. To that end, here we show how to formally
extract exact quantum energies from a coupled nuclear-electronic Hamiltonian
using perturbation theory on top of a phase space electronic framework. Thus,
while we cannot isolate an "optimal" phase space electronic Hamiltonian, this
work does justify a phase space electronic structure approach by offering a
rigorous framework for correcting the zeroth order phase space electronic
states.

Abstract: Recent explorations of quantized solitons transport in optical waveguides
have thrust nonlinear topological pumping into the spotlight. In this work, we
introduce a unified topological invariant applicable across both weakly and
strongly nonlinear regimes. In the weak nonlinearity regime, where the
nonlinear bands are wellseparated, the invariant reduces to the Abelian Chern
number of the occupied nonlinear band. Consequently, the pumped charge is
quantized to an integer value. As the nonlinearity increases, the nonlinear
bands start to intertwine, leading to a situation where the invariant is
expressed as the non-Abelian Chern number divided by the number of interacting
bands. This could result in a fractional quantization of the pumped charge. Our
unified topological invariant approach not only advances the understanding of
the soliton dynamics, but also provides implications for the future design of
nonlinear topological systems.

Abstract: Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom
is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing and metrology.
Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic $^{171}$Yb and
bosonic $^{174}$Yb atoms in two- and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical
lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution
offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure
efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep
the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap
inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband
spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D
ground state fractions of $97\%$ for $^{171}$Yb with an average motional
occupation of $\bar{n}\simeq0.015$ and provide a direct comparison with
$^{174}$Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in
3D results in $\bar{n}\simeq0.15$ limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in
the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional
ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic
alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening
the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral
atoms.
