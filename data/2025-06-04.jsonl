Here, we introduce the\nperfect entangler spectrum as a means to identify dynamic crosstalk leading to\nundesired entanglement. It leverages the geometric classification of two-qubit\ngates in terms of perfect entanglers. We exemplify application of the\nspectroscopy for fixed-frequency transmons and parametrically driven gates:\nWhen scanning the frequency of a spectator qubit, peaks in the perfect\nentangler spectrum signal dynamic crosstalk, and analysis of the peaks reveals\nthe mechanisms causing the crosstalk. We discuss the experimental\nimplementation of the crosstalk spectroscopy which requires two two-qubit gate\ntomographies."}

We\nconstruct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both\nholographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement,\nrevealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and\nnon-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically\nnon-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence\nand persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by\nthe holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free\nboundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even\noutside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite\ngeneralizations of discord, including a holography-inspired one based on\nmulti-entropy. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum\ncorrelations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and\noffer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures."}

Our analysis\nidentifies topological features unique to the honeycomb lattice.

In\nparticular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been\ndiscovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these\nare commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a\ngapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to\ntackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with\nhidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations\nalong appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state\ndegeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We\napply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT\ntransitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of\ncriticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the\nbulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT\nstate associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and\nconstitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless\nGoldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop\ngas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that\none of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$\n-- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature.
