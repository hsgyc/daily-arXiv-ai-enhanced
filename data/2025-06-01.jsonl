Zoned neutral atom\narchitectures allow for immense parallelism and higher coherence times by\nshielding idling atoms from interference with laser beams. However, in addition\nto hardware, successful quantum computation requires sophisticated software\nsupport, particularly compilers that optimize quantum algorithms for hardware\nexecution. In the compilation flow for zoned neutral atom architectures, the\neffective interplay of the placement and routing stages decides the overhead\ncaused by rearranging the atoms during the quantum computation. Sub-optimal\nplacements can lead to unnecessary serialization of the rearrangements in the\nsubsequent routing stage. Despite this, all existing compilers treat placement\nand routing independently thus far - focusing solely on minimizing travel\ndistances. This work introduces the first routing-aware placement method to\naddress this shortcoming.

It is thus an important\nquestion whether a qubit-cavity coupling can be realized that avoids such\neffects.

We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow\nus to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two\nsites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements\nbetween eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as\neigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing\non thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with\nthe exponential decay as $\\exp(-L\n|{M}^{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution\nfunctions of ${M}_{ij}^{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the\nobservable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel\ndistributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in\ndifferent macrostates decay faster as\n$\\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with\n${M'}_{ij}^{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel\ndistribution."}

In this work, we propose\na general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in\neven-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on\nconstructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the\noriginal NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via\nreduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A\nkey insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian\nspecifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the\ndynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH\nsystems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7,\nL012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from\nthe winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin\ntextures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH\nChern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional\nsystems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work\nestablishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological\ninvariants in quantum platforms."}

For each proposal, I choose one main philosophical\nquestion to discuss in depth. They are, respectively: what is a possible world;\nwhat is chance; and what is explanation. But before treating these proposals\nand their associated questions, I set the stage by reviewing physics and\nphilosophy from about 1600 to about 1900; and a final Chapter compares and\ncontrasts the proposals."}

Many software\nengineering tasks, such as test case selection, static analysis, code clone\ndetection, and defect prediction, involve complex optimization, search, or\nclassification, making them candidates for quantum enhancement. In this paper,\nwe propose Quantum-Based Software Engineering (QBSE), a potential research\ndirection for applying quantum computing to classical software engineering\nproblems. We outline its scope, clarify its distinction from quantum software\nengineering (QSE), and identify key problem types that may benefit from quantum\noptimization, search, and learning techniques. We also summarize existing\nresearch efforts that remain fragmented. Finally, we sketch a preliminary\nresearch agenda that may help guide the future development of QBSE as a\nstructured and meaningful direction within software engineering."}

In the topological superconducting phase of the\nheterostructure, the oscillations corresponding to different fermion parity\nsectors are shifted by half a period and can serve as a mechanism for fermion\nparity readout or fusion operations involving a pair of localized, well\nseparated Majorana modes. In this work, we demonstrate that flux induced\nfermion parity dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance in a\ndisordered semiconductor superconductor quantum dot system can originate not\nonly from topologically protected, spatially well separated Majorana zero modes\n(MZMs) localized at the wire ends, but also, generically, from partially\nseparated Majorana modes with significant overlap, as well as from\nquasi-Majorana modes in the topologically trivial phase, which can be viewed as\nAndreev bound states whose constituent Majorana wave functions are slightly\nshifted relative to each other and have nonzero amplitude at opposite ends of\nthe wire. Therefore, while the detection of flux dependent oscillations of\nquantum capacitance marks an important experimental advance, such observations\nalone do not constitute evidence of the presence of topological Majorana zero\nmodes."}
