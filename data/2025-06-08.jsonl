We show that some well-known\nnonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics, namely the Deutsch's map, the\nWeinberg's model, and the Schr\\\"odinger - Newton equation, map a contextual set\nof states to a non-contextual one.

Quantum\ntechnologies are evolving from theoretical concepts into tangible technologies\nwith commercial promise. Their rapid progress is capturing global attention and\nsuggests we stand on the cusp of a second quantum revolution. Unlocking the\nquantum opportunity is not simple. One challenge is that quantum technologies\ncan present a high barrier to understanding for nonexperts because they often\nrely on complex principles and concepts from a variety of specialist fields.\nThis can lead to confusion and intimidation for business leaders, educators,\npolicymakers and others. The Quantum Index Report aims to reduce the complexity\nand make it possible for a wider audience to have a deeper understanding of the\nquantum landscape. The Quantum Index Report provides a comprehensive,\ndata-driven assessment of the state of quantum technologies. For this inaugural\nedition we have focused on quantum computing and networking. The report tracks,\nmeasures, and visualizes trends across research, development, education and\npublic acceptance. It aggregates data from academia, industry and policy\nsources and aims to provide nonpartisan insights."}

To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the\nspectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay\nrate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven\ndissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian\ngap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals\nwhere the gap closes exponentially with system size.

In the experiment, we combine\nsupercontinuum polarization pulse shaping to generate OC-CRCP femtosecond laser\npulses with velocity map imaging-based photoelectron tomography to reconstruct\nthe 3D PMD. The reconstructed PMDs are decomposed by 3D Fourier analysis into\nSEVs of different rotational symmetry, revealing a significant enhancement of\nthe $c_6$-symmetric contribution, which is the signature of the V-RAP."}

We derive the\nenergy of the wavepacket to first order in the gradients of the perturbations.\nApplying the theory to the specific case of a uniform external magnetic field,\nwe obtain an expression for the orbital magnetization energy. Using the\nprinciples of non-Hermitian dynamics, we define a physically meaningful\nnon-Hermitian generalization of the angular momentum operator and show that it\nis compatible with the real part of the orbital magnetic moment. The imaginary\npart of the orbital magnetic moment is also discussed and shown to originate\nfrom an imaginary counterpart to the angular momentum that gives rise to a\nnon-Hermitian generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm effect."}

However, computing exact\nShapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature\ndimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic\nrandomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used\nbeing the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators\nsuch as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &\nWitter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for\nKernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework\nthat encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with\nand without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our\nframework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical\nguarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing\nestimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional\ndatasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact\nShapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest\nsample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to\nenable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,\ntested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results\ncompared to the KernelSHAP library."}
