### [1] [Information versus Physicality: On the Nature of the Wavefunctions of Quantum Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09062)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The physical states of matter and fields are represented in the quantum
theory with complex valued wavefunctions, or more generally by quantum states
in an abstract linear vector space. Determining the physical nature of
wavefunctions remains an open problem that is at the very core of quantum
mechanics, About a decade ago, Pusey, Barrett and Rudolf (PBR) claimed to prove
an ontologically real status of wavefunctions by ruling out $\psi$-epistemic
models. The result was obtained by associating wavefunctions to hypothetical
distributions of notional physical states, and by examining whether some
physical states were associated with more than one wavefunction, a criterion
they chose for defining a wavefunction as `epistemic'. I show that the starting
assumption in the PBR argument, of associating a wavefunction with a
distribution of physical states, is flawed and contradictory to the linear
structure of quantum mechanics coupled with its quadratic Born's rule. Since
none of the axioms or calculations of observable statistical results in the
standard quantum theory depends on specifying the physical nature of a
$\psi$-function, the considerations in the PBR paper, involving a standard
process of the preparation and projective measurements of quantum states,
cannot address the ontological status of the wavefunctions in space and time.

Result: 在DHCD数据集上达到99.80%的测试准确率，优于经典CNN。

Conclusion: 该工作为区域脚本识别设定了新基准，展示了量子机器学习在低资源语言环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Handwritten digit recognition in regional scripts, such as Devanagari, is
crucial for multilingual document digitization, educational tools, and the
preservation of cultural heritage. The script's complex structure and limited
annotated datasets pose significant challenges to conventional models. This
paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical architecture for Devanagari
handwritten digit recognition, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for spatial feature extraction with a 10-qubit variational quantum circuit
(VQC) for quantum-enhanced classification. Trained and evaluated on the
Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD), the proposed model achieves a
state-of-the-art test accuracy for quantum implementation of 99.80% and a test
loss of 0.2893, with an average per-class F1-score of 0.9980. Compared to
equivalent classical CNNs, our model demonstrates superior accuracy with
significantly fewer parameters and enhanced robustness. By leveraging quantum
principles such as superposition and entanglement, this work establishes a
novel benchmark for regional script recognition, highlighting the promise of
quantum machine learning (QML) in real-world, low-resource language settings.

### [3] [Enhancing quantum noise characterization via extra energy levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09131)

Result: 实验证明，在超导量子设备上使用qutrit能级显著提高了噪声表征的精度。

Conclusion: 该方案为量子噪声表征提供了新思路，有助于开发更有效的误差缓解和校正方法。

Abstract: Noise is a major challenge for building practical quantum computing systems.
Precise characterization of quantum noise is crucial for developing effective
error mitigation and correction schemes. However, state preparation and
measurement (SPAM) errors on many current platforms can introduce large
ambiguity into conventional noise characterization methods. In this work, we
propose a scheme for enhancing quantum noise characterization using additional
energy levels. We first develop a comprehensive theory on the identifiability
of n-qudit SPAM noise given high-quality single-qudit control, showing the
existence of gauge freedoms which can be completely described using subsystem
depolarizing maps. We then show how to use these extra energy levels to reduce
the gauge ambiguity in characterizing both SPAM and gate noise in the qubit
subspace. We experimentally implement these ideas on a superconducting quantum
computing device and demonstrate a qutrit-enabled enhancement in noise
characterization precision.

### [4] [Complexity of Contextuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09133)
*Theodoros Yianni,Farid Shahandeh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了广义上下文性在非经典理论（如量子力学）中的计算问题，提出了一个算法解决特定维度下非上下文本体模型的存在性问题，并分析了其复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决广义上下文性在非经典理论中的三个未解计算问题，特别是特定维度下非上下文本体模型的存在性及其复杂度。

Method: 通过几何公式化问题并将其简化为计算几何中的中间单纯形问题，提出算法。

Result: 发现判断维度k的非上下文本体模型存在性的复杂度至少为理论维度的指数级，至多为k的指数级，且计算最小模型通常效率低下。

Conclusion: 通过具体例子展示了最小非上下文本体模型与最小本体模型之间的根本差异，证明了计算最小非上下文模型的困难性。

Abstract: Generalized contextuality is a hallmark of nonclassical theories like quantum
mechanics. Yet, three fundamental computational problems concerning its
decidability and complexity remain open. First, determining the complexity of
deciding if a theory admits a noncontextual ontological model; Second,
determining the complexity of deciding if such a model is possible for a
specific dimension $k$; Third, efficiently computing the smallest such model
when it exists, given that finding the smallest ontological model is NP-hard.
We address the second problem by presenting an algorithm derived from a
geometric formulation and its reduction to the intermediate simplex problem in
computational geometry. We find that the complexity of deciding the existence
of a noncontextual ontological model of dimension $k$ is at least exponential
in the dimension of the theory and at most exponential in $k$. This, in turn,
implies that computing the smallest noncontextual ontological model is
inefficient in general. Finally, we demonstrate the fundamental difference
between finding the smallest noncontextual ontological model and the smallest
ontological model using an explicit example wherein the respective minimum
ontic sizes are five and four.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: NISQ设备能高效模拟复杂量子网络，提供灵活性、可扩展性和精确性。

Conclusion: NISQ设备可作为量子网络的自然测试平台，推动更高效的仿真方法。

Abstract: Complex quantum networks are not only hard to establish, but also difficult
to simulate due to the exponentially growing state space and noise-induced
imperfections. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that leverage
quantum computers and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices as
simulators for quantum networks, including noisy quantum devices, channels, and
protocols. Rather than considering noise as an undesired property that needs to
be mitigated, we demonstrate how imperfections in quantum hardware can be
utilized to simulate real-world communication devices under realistic
conditions beyond classical simulation capabilities. Our approach allows NISQ
devices with modest noise to simulate devices with more significant
imperfections enabling large-scale, detailed simulations of quantum networks,
where exact error models can be treated. It also improves over direct
implementation and benchmarking of real networks, as waiting times for
information transmission, locality, and memory restrictions do not apply. This
framework can offer advantages in flexibility, scalability, and precision,
demonstrating that NISQ devices can serve as natural testbeds for complex
quantum networks, and paving the way for more efficient quantum network
simulations.

### [6] [State-preparation and measurement error mitigation with non-computational states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09145)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用非计算态作为额外资源来学习超导量子比特中的状态准备误差的方法，从而完全约束噪声模型，独立且准确地缓解状态准备、门操作和测量误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子计算中的误差缓解方法依赖于对硬件噪声通道的准确表征，但存在无法学习的自由度问题。

Method: 通过利用非计算态作为额外资源，学习状态准备误差，从而完全约束噪声模型。

Result: 能够独立且准确地缓解状态准备、门操作和测量误差，适用于动态电路中的中间测量。

Conclusion: 该方法为改进电路末端和中间测量的误差缓解提供了新途径。

Abstract: Error mitigation has enabled quantum computing applications with over one
hundred qubits and deep circuits. The most general error mitigation methods
rely on a faithful characterization of the noise channels of the hardware.
However, fundamental limitations lead to unlearnable degrees of freedom of the
underlying noise models when considering qubits. Here, we show how to leverage
non-computational states as an additional resource to learn state-preparation
errors in superconducting qubits. This allows one to fully constrain the noise
models. We can thus independently and accurately mitigate state-preparation
errors, gate errors and measurement errors. Our proposed method is also
applicable to dynamic circuits with mid-circuit measurements. This work opens
the door to improved error mitigation for measurements, both at the end of the
circuit and mid-circuit.

### [7] [The Quantum Paldus Transform: Efficient Circuits with Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09151)
*Jędrzej Burkat,Nathan Fitzpatrick*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的量子算法——Quantum Paldus Transform，用于块对角化第二量子化中的费米子无自旋哈密顿量，结合UGA范式为量子计算化学提供新工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将Unitary Group Approach (UGA) 引入量子计算化学，以解决费米子系统的哈密顿量稀疏表示和高效量子态制备问题。

Method: 通过实现Howe的反称酉-酉对偶性，将费米子Fock空间与U(d)×SU(2)的不可约表示基（GT态）建立等距映射。

Result: 实现了哈密顿量的最大稀疏表示、高效配置态函数制备，并为量子信息编码提供了新的退相干自由子系统。

Conclusion: 该算法为量子模拟提供了新范式，并通过高效电路编译方法（O(d^3) Toffoli复杂度）推动了量子计算化学的发展。

Abstract: We present the Quantum Paldus Transform: an efficient quantum algorithm for
block-diagonalising fermionic, spin-free Hamiltonians in the second
quantisation. Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation
number basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin
(GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \times
SU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total
particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT
patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by
Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational
chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools
from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to
maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient
preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of
quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular
momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum
information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and
error mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur
transform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion
principle. Alongside self-contained derivations of the underlying dualities, we
provide fault-tolerant circuit compilation methods for the Paldus transform
with $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ Toffoli complexity, paving the way for significant
advancements in quantum simulation on quantum computers enabled by the UGA
paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升量子电路经典模拟的性能，为未来可扩展的异构实现奠定基础。

Result: 单量子比特门操作提速5.5-6.5倍，双量子比特门提速4.5倍，随机量子电路提速4倍，量子傅里叶变换提速1.8倍。

Conclusion: 严格的性能调优可显著扩展经典量子模拟器的实际模拟能力。

Abstract: Scalable classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for advancing
both quantum algorithm development and hardware validation. In this work, we
focus on performance enhancements through meticulous low-level tuning on a
single-node system, thereby not only advancing the performance of classical
quantum simulations but also laying the groundwork for scalable, heterogeneous
implementations that may eventually bridge the gap toward noiseless quantum
computing. Although similar efforts in low-level tuning have been reported in
the literature, such implementations have not been released as open-source
software, thereby impeding independent evaluation and further development. We
introduce an open-source, high-performance extension to the QuEST simulator
that brings state-of-the-art low-level and NUMA optimizations to modern
computers. Our approach emphasizes locality-aware computation and incorporates
hardware-specific optimizations such as NUMA-aware memory allocation, thread
pinning, AVX-512 vectorization, aggressive loop unrolling, and explicit memory
prefetching. Experiments demonstrate significant speedups - 5.5-6.5x for
single-qubit gate operations, 4.5x for two-qubit gates, 4x for Random Quantum
Circuits (RQC), and 1.8x for Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), demonstrating
that rigorous performance tuning can substantially extend the practical
simulation capacity of classical quantum simulators on current hardware.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于或匹配现有量子模型，且门数量显著减少。

Conclusion: GTQNNs在NISQ设备上实现了高性能和低资源消耗的平衡。

Abstract: We introduce Genetic Transformer Assisted Quantum Neural Networks (GTQNNs), a
hybrid learning framework that combines a transformer encoder with a shallow
variational quantum circuit and automatically fine tunes the circuit via the
NSGA-II multi objective genetic algorithm. The transformer reduces
high-dimensional classical data to a compact, qubit sized representation, while
NSGA-II searches for Pareto optimal circuits that (i) maximize classification
accuracy and (ii) minimize primitive gate count an essential constraint for
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Experiments on four
benchmarks (Iris, Breast Cancer, MNIST, and Heart Disease) show that GTQNNs
match or exceed state of the art quantum models while requiring much fewer
gates for most cases. A hybrid Fisher information analysis further reveals that
the trained networks operate far from barren plateaus; the leading curvature
directions increasingly align with the quantum subspace as the qubit budget
grows, confirming that the transformer front end has effectively condensed the
data. Together, these results demonstrate that GTQNNs deliver competitive
performance with a quantum resource budget well suited to present-day NISQ
devices.

Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial

algorithm for optimization (CACAO). In this algorithm, a solution of a given
combinatorial optimization problem is heuristically searched with classical
spin dynamics based on quantum Lyapunov control of local counterdiabatic

time-evolution algorithms, i.e., quantum annealing, the feedback-based
algorithm for quantum optimization (known as FALQON), and the counterdiabatic
feedback-based quantum algorithm (known as CD-FQA). We also study the
performance of CACAO applied to large systems up to $10,000$ spins.

Conclusion: 该方法为块正性矩阵的判定提供了有效工具，尤其在量子信息领域有潜在应用。

Abstract: We present an effective set of necessary and sufficient criteria for
block-positivity of matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{C}$. The approach is
based on Sturm sequences and quartic polynomial positivity conditions presented
in recent literature. The procedure allows us to test whether a given $4\times
4$ complex matrix corresponds to an entanglement witness, and it is exact when
the matrix coefficients belong to the rationals, extended by $\mathrm{i}$. The
method can be generalized to $\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\mathcal{H}_d$ systems for
$d>2$ to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity.
We also outline an alternative approach to the problem relying on Gr\"obner
bases.

computational cost of $ \tilde{O}(\beta \log{1/\epsilon})$. Our approach saves
$\log(\Gamma)$ ancilla qubits compared with the qubitization-based methods for
Hamiltonian with $\Gamma$ stages. To provide a robust assessment of our
approach, we benchmark our results against state-of-the-art methodology using
the SYK model as a testbed. Our method provides an efficient alternative method
for Gibbs-state accessing based on Trotterization in the context of quantum
state preparation and estimation of thermal observables.

Result: 在两能级和三能级系统中，该方案比传统STIRAP协议具有更高保真度，显著抑制非绝热跃迁。

Conclusion: 该方案在保持鲁棒性的同时实现了快速绝热演化，适用于量子信息处理。

Abstract: In quantum information processing, the development of fast and robust control
schemes remains a central challenge. Although quantum adiabatic evolution is
inherently robust against control errors, it typically demands long evolution
times. In this work, we propose to achieve rapid adiabatic evolution, in which
nonadiabatic transitions induced by fast changes in the system Hamiltonian are
mitigated by flipping the nonadiabatic transition matrix using $\pi$ pulses.
This enables a faster realization of adiabatic evolution while preserving its
robustness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in both two-level
and three-level systems. Numerical simulations show that, for the same
evolution duration, our scheme achieves higher fidelity and significantly
suppresses nonadiabatic transitions compared to the traditional STIRAP
protocol.

Conclusion: 该方法推动了量子电路编译技术，支持在资源受限的模块化系统上运行更复杂的量子算法，促进可扩展量子计算架构的研究。

Abstract: Modular quantum architectures have emerged as a promising approach for
scaling quantum computing systems by connecting multiple Quantum Processing
Units (QPUs). However, this approach introduces significant challenges due to
costly inter-core operations between chips and quantum state transfers, which
contribute to noise and quantum decoherence. This paper presents QARMA, a novel
Qubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for
Modular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that
incorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an
attention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal
qubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core
communications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a transformer-based
encoder that captures both the global circuit structure and local qubit
interactions and (2) a dynamic qubit reuse compilation mechanism that leverages
mid-circuit measurement and reset operations to reduce inter-operation and
qubit requirements. Our experimental results show significant improvements over
state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular
architecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to
100% (on average 85%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger
circuits without reuse. Against traditional modular qubit mapping, our approach
achieves 96.4-100% reduction in inter-core operation. The proposed methods
advance quantum circuit compilation techniques and enable the execution of more
extensive quantum algorithms on resource-constrained modular quantum systems,
contributing to the growing body of research on scalable quantum computing
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 绝热HQC虽然对某些控制误差具有鲁棒性，但运行时间长限制了实用性；非绝热HQC速度快但牺牲了鲁棒性。

Result: 实现了单量子比特和双量子比特控制门的通用集合，提供可调参数以灵活设计门。

Conclusion: 该方案为高保真、快速且鲁棒的量子计算提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Holonomic quantum computation (HQC) offers an inherently robust approach to
quantum gate implementation by exploiting quantum holonomies. While adiabatic
HQC benefits from robustness against certain control errors, its long runtime
limits practical utility due to increased exposure to environmental noise.
Nonadiabatic HQC addresses this issue by enabling faster gate operations but
compromises robustness. In this work, we propose a scheme for fast holonomic
quantum gates based on the $\pi$-pulse method, which accelerates adiabatic
evolution while preserving its robustness. By guiding the system Hamiltonian
along geodesic paths in the parameter space and applying phase-modulating $\pi$
pulses at discrete points, we realize a universal set of holonomic gates beyond
the conventional adiabatic limit. Our scheme allows for arbitrary single-qubit
and two-qubit controlled gates within a single-loop evolution and provides
additional tunable parameters for flexible gate design. These results
demonstrate a promising path toward high-fidelity, fast, and robust quantum
computation.

Abstract: Demonstration of quantum advantage remains challenging due to the increased
overhead of controlling large quantum systems. While significant effort has
been devoted to qubit-based devices, qudits ($d$-level systems) offer potential
advantages in both hardware efficiency and algorithmic performance. In this
paper, we demonstrate multi-tone control of a single trapped ion qudit of up to
eight levels, as well as the first implementation of Grover's search algorithm
on a qudit with dimension five and eight, achieving operation fidelity of
96.8(3)$\%$ and 69(6)$\%$, respectively, which correspond to 99.9(1)\% and
97.1(3) \% squared statistical overlap (SSO), respectively, with the expected
result for a single iteration of the Grover search algorithm. The performance
is competitive when compared to qubit-based systems; moreover, the sequence
requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$ single qudit gates and no entangling gates. This
work highlights the potential of using qudits for efficient implementations of
quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Nonlocality exhibited by ensembles of composite quantum states, wherein local
operations and classical communication (LOCC) yield suboptimal discrimination
probabilities compared to global strategies, is one of the striking
nonclassical features of quantum theory. A variant of this phenomenon arises in
conclusive local state discrimination, where the correct state must be
identified with zero error, albeit allowing for inconclusive outcomes. More
recently, the notion of local state marking has been introduced with the focus
shifted to correctly identifying permutation of a subset of states random
chosen from a given set of multipartite states under LOCC. In this work, we
unify these two approaches by introducing the task of conclusive local state
marking, which reveals a finer hierarchy of nonlocality in multipartite quantum
state ensembles. Notably, we demonstrate that certain ensembles of product
states can exhibit a stronger form of nonlocality than entangled ensembles
traditionally considered highly nonlocal.

Abstract: Surrogates have been proposed as classical simulations of the pretrained
quantum learning models, which are capable of mimicking the input-output
relation inherent in the quantum model. Quantum hardware within this framework
is used for training and for generating the classical surrogates. Inference is
relegated to the classical surrogate, hence alleviating the extra quantum
computational cost once training is done. Taking inspiration from interpretable
models, we introduce a local surrogation protocol based on reuploading-type
quantum learning models, including local quantum surrogates as cost-efficient
intermediate quantum learning models. When the training and inference are only
concerned with a subregion of the data space, deploying a local quantum
surrogate offers qubit cost reductions and the downstream local classical
surrogate achieves dequantization of the inference phase. Several numerical
experiments are presented.

Conclusion: 能量限制可能是精度提升的关键障碍。

Abstract: Quantum metrology promises enhanced precision in parameter estimation by
exploiting quantum effects. The traditional framework of metrology commonly
assumes unlimited access to resources, overlooking resource constraints in
realistic scenarios. As such, the optimal strategies therein are often
infeasible in practice. Here, we investigate quantum metrology where the total
energy consumption of the probe state preparation, intermediate control
operations, and the final measurement is subject to an energy constraint. We
establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for characterizing
energy-constrained quantum multi-step processes, which can be applied to other
tasks of quantum information processing beyond metrology. Based on the
framework, we develop a general optimization method for energy-constrained
quantum metrology that determines the optimal precision as well as the
corresponding optimal strategy. Applying our method to phase estimation, we
show that while the estimation precision can benefit arbitrarily from
increasing dimension with unconstrained energy, energy constraints result in an
ultimate precision scaling of $1/E^2$ in an infinite-dimensional system, where
$E$ is the available energy, which reveals that limited energy could be an
essential barrier to precision improvement.

Abstract: We explore covert entanglement generation over the lossy thermal-noise
bosonic channel, which is a quantum-mechanical model of many practical
settings, including optical, microwave, and radio-frequency (RF) channels.
Covert communication ensures that an adversary is unable to detect the presence
of transmissions, which are concealed in channel noise. We show that a
$\textit{square root law}$ (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to
that for classical: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be
generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a
single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable
method. We additionally analyze the performance of covert entanglement
generation using single- and dual-rail photonic qubits, which may be more
practical for physical implementation.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子信息任务和量子计量提供了更高的灵活性，并通过联合谱和Hong-Ou-Mandel干涉验证了纠缠态。

Abstract: We propose a method to generate the frequency entanglement, allowing a
continuous generation of entangled two-photon states in a hybrid degree of
freedom by post-manipulation. Our method is based on type-II spontaneous
parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal and the rotation Doppler
effect by rotating the q-plates, without preset discrete frequency
entanglement. This allows the arbitrary modification of frequency entangled
photons in a wide frequency range at room temperature, offering enhanced
flexibility for quantum information tasks and quantum metrology. We also
analyze the entanglement state by a combined calculation for the joint spectrum
and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of the two photons, which can be used to
reconstruct a restricted density matrix in the frequency space.

Conclusion: Q-MDN展示了量子机器学习在概率回归中的实际优势，能够捕捉经典模型难以处理的复杂随机行为。

Abstract: Multimodal probability distributions are common in both quantum and classical
systems, yet modeling them remains challenging when the number of modes is
large or unknown. Classical methods such as mixture-density networks (MDNs)
scale poorly, requiring parameter counts that grow quadratically with the
number of modes. We introduce a Quantum Mixture-Density Network (Q-MDN) that
employs parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently model multimodal
distributions. By representing an exponential number of modes with a compact
set of qubits and parameters, Q-MDN predicts Gaussian mixture components with
high resolution. We evaluate Q-MDN on two benchmark tasks: the quantum
double-slit experiment and chaotic logistic bifurcation. In both cases, Q-MDN
outperforms classical MDNs in mode separability and prediction sharpness under
equal parameter budgets. Our results demonstrate a practical quantum advantage
in probabilistic regression and highlight the potential of quantum machine
learning in capturing complex stochastic behavior beyond the reach of classical
models.

Conclusion: 优化多钻石几何结构和大动量转移技术是提升探测器性能的关键，但需优先解决脉冲保真度问题。

Abstract: Currently planned and constructed terrestrial detectors for gravitational
waves and dark matter based on differential light-pulse atom interferometry are
designed around three primary strategies to enhance their sensitivity: (i)
Resonant-mode enhancement using multiple diamonds, (ii) large-momentum-transfer
techniques to increase arm separation within the interferometer, and (iii)
very-long baseline schemes that increase the distance between the two
interferometers. Both resonant-mode enhancement and large-momentum-transfer
techniques result in a greater number of light pulses, making high pulse
fidelity during atom-light interactions imperative. At the same time,
increasing the number of diamonds in vertical configurations leads to taller
atomic fountains, which consequently reduces the available distance between
interferometers. As a result, the number of diamonds, large-momentum-transfer
pulses, and the fountain height are interdependent parameters that must be
carefully balanced. In this work, we present optimal configurations for
multi-diamond geometries, explicitly accounting for the spatial extent of a
single interferometer, considering constraints imposed by the baseline
dimensions and atomic losses due to imperfect pulses. We provide practical
analytical relations to estimate the optimal number of pulses that should be
applied. Many proposals beyond demonstrator experiments require pulse numbers
that demand efficiencies not yet demonstrated with state-of-the-art momentum
transfer techniques. As a result, the observed sensitivity falls short of
expectations - an effect caused by both arm separation and atom loss per pulse
- highlighting the urgent need for research aimed at improving pulse
fidelities.

Abstract: The field of variational quantum algorithms, in particular quantum machine
learning (QML), produced numerous theoretical and empirical insights in recent
years. As variational quantum circuits (VQCs) can be represented by Fourier
series that contain an exponentially large spectrum in the number of input
features, hope for quantum advantage remains. Nevertheless, properties of
quantum Fourier models (QFMs) are not yet fully understood, in particular how
they could potentially outperform classical alternatives. Viewing VQCs with
Fourier lenses opens up possibilities to analyse which classes of functions can
be tackled by variational algorithms such as QML, while also illuminating and
quantifying remaining constraints and challenges. Considering that noise and
imperfections remain dominant factors in the development trajectory from noisy
intermediate-scale to fault-tolerant quantum computers, the aim of this work is
to shed light on key properties of QFMs when exposed to noise. In particular,
we systematically analyse the effect of noise on the Fourier spectrum,
expressibility and entangling capability of QFMs by conducting large-scale
numerical simulations of quantum systems. This may help to better utilise
hardware resources, and guide the construction of tailored error correction
schemes. We find that decoherent noise exerts a uniform deleterious effect on
all the tested ans\"atze, manifesting in the vanishing of Fourier coefficients,
expressibility and entangling capability. We note however, that the detrimental
influence of noise is less pronounced in some ans\"atze than in others,
suggesting that these might possess greater resilience to noise.

Abstract: We introduce a systematic method for constructing polytope approximations to
the quantum set in a variety of device-independent quantum random number
generation (DI-QRNG) protocols. Our approach relies on two general-purpose
algorithms that iteratively refine an initial outer-polytope approximation,
guided by typical device behaviour and cryptographic intuition. These
refinements strike a balance between computational tractability and
approximation effectiveness. By integrating these approximations into the
probability estimation (PE) framework [Zhang et al., PRA 2018], we obtain
significantly improved certified entropy bounds in the finite-size regime. We
test our method on various bipartite and tripartite DI-QRNG protocols, using
both simulated and experimental data. In all cases, it yields notably higher
entropy rates with fewer device uses than the existing techniques. We further
extend our analysis to the more demanding task of randomness amplification,
demonstrating major performance gains without added complexity. These results
offer an effective and ready-to-use method to prove security-with improved
certified entropy rates-in the most common practical DI-QRNG protocols. Our
algorithms and entropy certification with PE tools are publicly available under
a non-commercial license at https://github.com/CQCL/PE_polytope_approximation.

Conclusion: 尽管负性哈密顿量与费米子负性哈密顿量在形式上差异显著，但其对数负性在弹道标度极限下表现一致，且对称性分解结果相同。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quench dynamics of the negativity and
fermionic negativity Hamiltonians in free fermionic systems. We do this by
generalizing a recently developed quasiparticle picture for the entanglement
Hamiltonians to tripartite geometries. We obtain analytic expressions for these
quantities which are then extensively checked against previous results and
numerics. In particular, we find that the standard negativity Hamiltonian
contains both non-local hopping terms and four fermion interactions, whereas
the fermionic version is purely quadratic. However, despite their marked
difference, we show that the logarithmic negativity obtained from either are
identical in the ballistic scaling limit, as are their symmetry resolution.

Abstract: The fidelity of operations on a solid-state quantum processor is ultimately
bounded by decoherence effects induced by a fluctuating environment.
Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the
acquisition time of experimental protocols limits the precision with which the
environment can be measured and may obscure the detailed structure of these
fluctuations. Here we present a real-time Bayesian method for estimating the
relaxation rate of a qubit, leveraging a classical controller with an
integrated field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Using our FPGA-powered
Bayesian method, we adaptively and continuously track the relaxation-time
fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which
exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally
exceed 0.5 ms. Our technique allows for the estimation of these relaxation
times in a few milliseconds, more than two orders of magnitude faster than
previous nonadaptive methods, and allows us to observe fluctuations up to 5
times the qubit's average relaxation rates on significantly shorter timescales
than previously reported. Our statistical analysis reveals that these
fluctuations occur on much faster timescales than previously understood, with
two-level-system switching rates reaching up to 10 Hz. Our work offers an
appealing solution for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device
screening and for improved understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.

Abstract: Entangled two-mode Gaussian states constitute an important building block for
continuous variable quantum computing and communication protocols and are thus
of high demand for many experiments. In this work, we study such kind of states
which are extracted from multimode light generated via type-II parametric
down-conversion (PDC) in lossy waveguides. For such states, we demonstrate that
the squeezing quantifies entanglement and we construct a measurement basis
which results in the maximal bipartite entanglement. We illustrate our findings
by numerically solving the spatial master equation for PDC in a Markovian
environment. The optimal measurement modes are compared with two widely-used
broadband bases: the Mercer-Wolf basis (the first-order coherence basis) and
the Williamson-Euler basis.

Abstract: Quantumness imposes a fundamental limit on measurement accuracy. The
paradigmatic cases are Heisenberg's uncertainty relation in the original
formulation, Robertson's formulation, and improved uncertainty relations.
However, the more universal measures are given in terms of quantum entropies.
Uncertainties of measurements done on one quantum system correlated with
another quantum system constitute a more intriguing question. Quantum
correlations can influence the lower bound of uncertainties, and the reason for
this is the quantum memory. In this article, we study uncertainties of
measurements performed on one quantum dot correlated with the second one
through the superconductor, hosting the Majorana boundary modes. We prove that
the Majorana quasiparticles allow the uncertainties to reach the minimal
possible lower bound. By rigorous theoretical considerations, we obtain the
result of experimental relevance expressed in terms of only two parameters: the
overlap between Majorana modes and their coupling strength with the quantum
dots. We show that the overlap between Majorana modes reduces quantum
uncertainties, which is a general result of fundamental importance. We also
propose the protocol to measure spins in both quantum dots, consecutively, and
demonstrate that the result of the second measurement would depend on the
presence of Majorana quasiparticles. This could serve as an indirect tool for
their empirical observation, which is of importance for the ongoing discussions
concerning unambiguous detection of the Majorana quasiparticles in nanoscopic
hybrid structures.

Abstract: We explore a potential connection between the black hole information paradox
and the double descent phenomenon in quantum machine learning. Information
retrieval from Hawking radiation can be viewed through the lens of quantum
linear regression over black hole microstates, with the Page time corresponding
to the interpolation threshold, beyond which test error decreases despite
overparameterization. Using the Marchenko-Pastur law, we derive the variance in
test error for the quantum linear regression problem and show that the
transition across the Page time is associated with a change in the rank
structure of subsystems. This observation suggests a conceptual parallel
between black hole physics and machine learning that may provide new
perspectives for both fields.

Abstract: We present a native approach for realizing multi-qubit parity phase gates in
neutral atom systems through global phase modulation of a Rydberg excitation
laser. By shaping the temporal profile of the laser's phase, we enable high
fidelity, time efficient entangling operations between multiple qubits without
requiring individual qubit addressing. To mitigate intrinsic noise sources
including spontaneous decay and motional effects, we develop a noise-aware
optimal control framework that reduces gate errors under the presence of noise
while maintaining smooth pulse profiles suitable for experimental
implementation. In addition to equidistant qubit arrangements, we explore the
impact of non-equidistant atomic configurations, where interaction
inhomogeneity becomes significant. In these cases, the flexibility of our
control approach helps to compensate for such variations, supporting reliable
gate performance across different spatial layouts. These results facilitate the
practical implementation of complex, multi-qubit quantum operations in
near-term neutral atom quantum processors.

produced by Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), are a key resource
for quantum technologies. In recent years, camera-based coincidence counting
approaches have considerably improved the ability to characterize them in terms
of speed and dimensionality. However, these methods have limitations, including
in most of them the necessity to subtract accidental coincidences. Here, we
study the role of these accidentals in entanglement certification for a
single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array and an intensified time-stamping
(Tpx3Cam) camera. Using both Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) and entropy-based
criteria, we show that the level of accidental coincidences - determined by the
temporal characteristics of the camera - and whether they are subtracted
critically impact entanglement certification. In particular, we demonstrate
that current single-photon camera technologies enable entanglement
certification without accidental subtraction only if a Gaussian approximation
is applied to the measured two-photon state. Our work is important for
developing quantum-optics application in adversarial scenarios, such as
high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD), and also for loophole-free
experimental testing of quantum foundations.

Abstract: Complex numbers are theoretically proved and experimentally confirmed as
necessary in quantum mechanics and quantum information, and a resource theory
of imaginarity of quantum states has been established. In this work, we
establish a framework to quantify the imaginarity of quantum operations from
the perspective of the ability to create or detect imaginarity, following the
idea by Theurer {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{122}, 190405 (2019)]
used in coherence theory. We present two types of imaginarity measures of
quantum operations based on the norm and the weight, investigate their
properties and relations, and derive the analytical formulas of the measure
under the trace norm for qubit unitary operations. The results provide new
insights into imaginarity of operations and deepen our understanding of
dynamical imaginarity.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have attracted considerable interest over the last few
decades due to their unique spectral and dynamical properties not encountered
in Hermitian counterparts. An intensely debated question is whether
non-Hermitian systems, described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real
spectra, can offer enhanced sensitivity for parameter estimation when they are
operated at or close to exceptional points. However, much of the current
analysis and conclusions are based on mathematical formalism developed for
Hermitian quantum systems, which is questionable when applied to
pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose Hilbert space is intrinsically curved.
Here, we develop a covariant formulation of quantum Fisher information (QFI)
defined on the curved Hilbert space of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This
covariant framework ensures the preservation of the state norm and enables a
consistent treatment of parameter sensitivity. We further show that the
covariant QFI of pseudo-Hermitian systems can be mapped to the ordinary QFI of
corresponding Hermitian systems, and establish conditions when they become dual
to each other, thus revealing a deeper geometric connection between the two.
Importantly, this correspondence naturally imposes an upper bound on the
covariant QFI and identifies the criteria under which quantum sensing in
pseudo-Hermitian systems can exhibit supremacy over Hermitian ones.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) allows two distant
parties to establish a secret key, based only on the observed Bell nonlocal
distribution. It remains however, unclear what the minimal resources for
enabling DIQKD are and how to maximize the key rate from a given distribution.
In the present work, we consider a scenario where several copies of a given
quantum distribution are jointly processed via a local and classical wiring
operation. We find that, under few assumptions, it is possible to activate
device-independent key. That is, starting from a distribution that is useless
in a DIQKD protocol, we obtain a positive key rate by wiring several copies
together. We coin this effect device-independent key activation. Our analysis
focuses on the standard DIQKD protocol with one-way post-processing, and we
resort to semi-definite programming techniques for computing lower bounds on
the key rate.

derived inequalities by explicit examples in two dimensional spaces, showing
that the lower bounds can be regarded as good approximations to averaged
coherence quantifiers under certain circumstances.

Abstract: The theory of optimal transport of probability measures has wide-ranging
applications across a number of different fields, including concentration of
measure, machine learning, Markov chains, and economics. The generalisation of
optimal transport tools from probability measures to quantum states has shown
great promise over the last few years, particularly in the development of the
theory of Wasserstein-style distances and divergences between quantum states.
Such distances have already led to a broad range of developments in the quantum
setting such as functional inequalities, convergence of solutions in many-body
physics, improvements to quantum generative adversarial networks, and more.
However, the literature in this field is quite scattered, with very few links
between different works and no real consensus on a `true' quantum Wasserstein
distance. The aim of this review is to bring these works together under one
roof and give a full overview of the state of the art in the development of
quantum Wasserstein distances. We also present a variety of open problems and
unexplored avenues in the field, and examine the future directions of this
promising line of research. This review is written for those interested in
quantum optimal transport in coming from both the fields of classical optimal
transport and of quantum information theory, and as a resource for those
working in one area of quantum optimal transport interested in how existing
work may relate to their own.

Abstract: In the last decade, quantum computing has grown from novel physics
experiments with a few qubits to commercial systems with hundreds of qubits. As
quantum computers continue to grow in qubit count, the classical control
systems must scale correspondingly. While a few expensive multi-board
commercial solutions exist, most open-source solutions are limited to
single-board radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC). The essential requirements
for a multi-board solution are clock synchronization among multiple boards and
the ability to transfer data with low latency for performing real-time
feedback. In this work, we design a clock synchronization framework to
distribute deterministic clock and synchronize the clock counters across
multiple RFSoC boards to generate time-aligned radio frequency (RF) pulses used
to control qubits. We also develop a data communication system over a fiber
link to transfer quantum measurement data among multiple field-programmable
gate arrays (FPGAs). This clock synchronization and data communication module
has been integrated into the open-source quantum control system, QubiC, to
enable the execution of quantum algorithms across multiple boards. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our design through bench tests with a
room-temperature qubit readout emulator.

Conclusion: 亚吸收是一种新的集体耦合效应，其存在依赖于长程偶极-偶极关联，但对退相干极为敏感。

Abstract: We predict and experimentally demonstrate a new type of collective
(cooperative) coupling effect where a disordered atomic ensemble absorbs light
with a rise-time longer (i. e., at a rate slower) than what is dictated by
single-atom physics. This effect, which we name subabsorption, can be viewed as
the absorptive analog of subradiance. The experiment is performed using a
dilute ensemble of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms with a low optical depth, and
time-resolving the absorption of a weak (tens of photons per pulse) resonant
laser beam. In this dilute regime, the collective interaction relies on
establishing dipole-dipole correlations over many atoms; i.e., the interaction
is not dominated by the nearest neighbors. As a result, subabsorption is highly
susceptible to motional dephasing: even a temperature increase of 60 $\mu$K is
enough to completely extinguish the subabsorption signal. We also present a
theoretical model whose results are in reasonable agreement with the
experimental observations. The model uses density-dependent dephasing rate of
the long-range dipole-dipole correlations as a single adjustable parameter.
Experiment-theory comparison indicates a dephasing coefficient of $\beta/2 \pi
= 4.9 \times 10^{-5}$ Hz~cm$^3$, which is more than two orders of magnitude
larger than the known dipole-dipole line broadening coefficient in $^{87}$Rb.

Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important
information to identify the universality class and effective field theory,
which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying
symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the
order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires
further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by
itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to
numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in
quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy
effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a
very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of
states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent)
symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement
spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after
cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.

Abstract: The dynamics of quantum many-body systems in the chaotic regime are of
particular interest due to the associated phenomena of information scrambling
and entanglement generation within the system. While these systems are
typically intractable using traditional numerical methods, an effective
framework can be implemented based on dual-unitary circuits which have emerged
as a minimal model for maximally chaotic dynamics. In this work, we investigate
how individual two-body operators influence the global dynamics of circuits
composed of dual-unitaries. We study their effect on entanglement generation
while examining it from both bipartite and multipartite perspectives. Here we
also highlight the significant role of local unitaries in the dynamics when
paired with operators from the dual-unitary class, showing that systems with
identical entangling power can exhibit a range of differing entanglement growth
rates. Furthermore, we present calculations establishing time-step-dependent
lower bounds, which depend on both the initial state and the entangling power
of the constituent operators. Finally, we find that time-evolving an initial
state composed of pair products generates a state with nearly maximal
multipartite entanglement content, approaching the bounds established by
Absolutely Maximally Entangled (AME) states.

Abstract: Quantum processors based on neutral atoms trapped in arrays of optical
tweezers have appealing properties, including relatively easy qubit number
scaling and the ability to engineer arbitrary gate connectivity with atom
movement. However, these platforms are inherently prone to atom loss, and the
ability to replace lost atoms during a quantum computation is an important but
previously elusive capability. Here, we demonstrate the ability to measure and
re-initialize, and if necessary replace, a subset of atoms while maintaining
coherence in other atoms. This allows us to perform logical circuits that
include single and two-qubit gates as well as repeated midcircuit measurement
while compensating for atom loss. We highlight this capability by performing up
to 41 rounds of syndrome extraction in a repetition code, and combine
midcircuit measurement and atom replacement with real-time conditional
branching to demonstrate heralded state preparation of a logically encoded Bell
state. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to replenish atoms in a tweezer
array from an atomic beam while maintaining coherence of existing atoms -- a
key step towards execution of logical computations that last longer than the
lifetime of an atom in the system.

Abstract: We certify asymmetry in the configuration of the Bloch vectors of a set of
three unknown qubit states within the dimensionally bounded prepare-and-measure
scenario. To do this, we construct a linear witness from three simpler
witnesses as building blocks, each featuring, along with two binary measurement
settings, three preparations; two of them are associated with the certification
task, while the third one serves as an auxiliary. The final witness is chosen
to self-test some target configuration. We numerically derive a bound
$Q_{\text{mirror}}$ for any mirror-symmetric configuration, thereby certifying
asymmetry if this bound is exceeded (e.g. experimentally) for the unknown qubit
configuration. We also consider the gap $(Q_{\text{max}}-Q_{\text{mirror}})$
between the analytically derived overall quantum maximum $Q_{\text{max}}$ and
the mirror-symmetric bound, and use it as a quantifier of asymmetry in the
target configuration. Numerical optimization shows that the most asymmetric
configuration then forms a right scalene triangle on the unit Bloch sphere.
Finally, we implement our protocol on a public quantum processor, where a clear
violation of the mirror-symmetric bound certifies asymmetry in the
configuration of our experimental triple of qubit states.

Abstract: The $N$-representability problem places fundamental constraints on reduced
density matrices (RDMs) that originate from physical many-fermion quantum
states. Motivated by recent developments in functional theories, we introduce a
hierarchy of ensemble one-body $N$-representability problems that incorporate
partial knowledge of the one-body reduced density matrices (1RDMs) within an
ensemble of $N$-fermion states with fixed weights $w_i$. Specifically, we
propose a systematic relaxation that reduces the refined problem -- where full
1RDMs are fixed for certain ensemble elements -- to a more tractable form
involving only natural occupation number vectors. Remarkably, we show that this
relaxed problem is related to a generalization of Horn's problem, enabling an
explicit solution by combining its constraints with those of the weighted
ensemble $N$-representability conditions. An additional convex relaxation
yields a convex polytope that provides physically meaningful restrictions on
lattice site occupations in ensemble density functional theory for excited
states.

Result: 多初始参考态能显著改善算法收敛性，尤其在精度受限的模拟中。QBKSP还能计算简并态及其多重性。

Conclusion: QBKSP算法在计算低能级特征值和简并态方面表现出色，多参考态策略提升了收敛性和实用性。

Abstract: Determining eigenvalues is a computationally expensive task that is crucial
for countless applications in natural sciences. Toward this end, we introduce
the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm, a multireference
quantum variant of the Lanczos algorithm designed to accurately compute
low-lying eigenvalues, including degenerate states. We present three different
compact quantum circuits to evaluate the required expectation values, each
suited to different problem settings. To investigate the impact of the number
and fidelity of the initial reference states, as well as time evolution
duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and
quantum circuit simulations. The results demonstrate that using multiple
initial reference states improves the convergence of the algorithm, especially
in realistic precision-limited simulations and in cases where a single
reference fails to simultaneously retrieve all desired eigenvalues.
Furthermore, the QBKSP algorithm enables the computation of degenerate
eigenstates and respective multiplicity by imposing appropriate convergence
criteria.

### [50] [MetaTT: A Global Tensor-Train Adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09105)
*Javier Lopez-Piqueres,Pranav Deshpande,Archan Ray,Mattia J. Villani,Marco Pistoia,Niraj Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaTT是一个统一的Tensor Train适配器框架，用于预训练Transformer的全局低秩微调，相比LoRA，它显著减少了参数数量，同时保持相似的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有微调方法（如LoRA）独立调整每个权重矩阵导致的参数冗余问题，MetaTT提出了一种共享TT分解的方法，以更高效地压缩适配器。

Method: MetaTT使用单一的共享TT分解所有Transformer子模块（如查询、键、值等），并通过索引结构轴（如层和矩阵类型）实现参数共享。它还支持动态添加新模式，适用于多任务共享适配器。

Result: 在标准语言建模基准测试中，MetaTT在显著减少参数的同时，保持了与LoRA相似的准确性，甚至优于其他基于张量的方法。

Conclusion: MetaTT通过TT分解和成熟的优化方法（如DMRG风格的自适应最小化），提供了一种高效且灵活的微调方案，适用于多任务场景。

Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global
low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes
each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize
all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward
layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and
optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters
proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters
proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed
final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent
state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We
observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads
to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to
LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other
rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines
-- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we
find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT
naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the
core tensor.

Motivation: 解决图神经网络（GNNs）处理大图时的高内存需求和稀疏矩阵操作效率低的问题，同时探索量子计算（QC）在图神经网络中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出Guided Graph Compression（GGC）框架，利用图自动编码器压缩节点数量和特征维度，并优化下游分类任务性能。

Result: 在Jet Tagging任务中，GGC表现优于单独使用自动编码器预处理和经典GNN分类器，同时支持在真实数据集上测试新型QGNN方法。

Conclusion: GGC框架有效解决了大图处理问题，并为量子图神经网络的实际应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured
data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and
inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a
promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic
approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been
explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the
dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches
either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work
introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph
autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node
features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream
classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical
classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a
classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that
involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons.
The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing
step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results
demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the
testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

Abstract: We demonstrate wide-field optical microscopy of the pressure distribution at
approximately 20 GPa in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), using nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) as quantum sensors. Pressure and
non-hydrostaticity maps are obtained by fitting optically detected magnetic

Motivation: 探索在分数霍尔态和超导体共存的条件下，anyon超导性如何从排斥相互作用中自然产生。

Method: 通过理论分析和张量网络模拟，研究了FCI在特定填充下的量子相变及其对Cooper对关联的增强作用。

Result: 发现2e/3 anyon比孤立e/3 anyon对更便宜，导致在相变附近Cooper配对显著增强，从而实现超导。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了anyon超导性的理论，为实验提供了指导，尤其是在扭曲MoTe2等平带材料中。

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require
contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same
device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to
superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally
charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has
mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how
anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show
that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern
insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward
a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic
charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the
transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional
charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we
analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model.
Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with
increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable
semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state
competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this
transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our
theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons.
Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and
charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central
charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our
framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it
with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials
such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.

Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion
2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the
Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266,
arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model
construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider ``All boson
type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form
symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized
gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup
$H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as
the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data
that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians
and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such
symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In
light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section
presenting the main results and examples.

Motivation: 探索高频引力波背景，提升现有探测器的灵敏度，接近单引力子水平。

Method: 在磁化腔中通过qumode连续制备和非破坏性测量，实现引力波到单光子的共振转换。

Result: 在微波频率下，灵敏度接近宇宙学界限；光学频率下灵敏度提升一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法有望突破现有技术限制，首次探测高频宇宙引力波背景。

Abstract: We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency
gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational
wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an
occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion
probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics.
Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously
prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit
system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at
microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can
attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound.
With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this
limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological
gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the
sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further
enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.

Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized
light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation
of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow
and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that,
under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%.
Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be
precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the
potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of
light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with
the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the
nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker

Motivation: EPs因其在传感器中的潜在应用而受到关注，但其对模型误差的敏感性和精度损失问题限制了实际应用。TPDs被认为可能解决这些问题，但缺乏统一的实验验证和理论框架。

Method: 通过微波磁子-光子二聚体实验平台，研究了多种TPDs，并提出了基于合成规范场的统一理论和实验框架。

Result: 实验验证了TPDs的性能和鲁棒性，并提出了新的量化指标。

Conclusion: 该研究为EPs和TPDs的统一提供了理论和实验基础，可能推动鲁棒TPD增强传感器的实现。

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian
dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to
enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency
splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly
contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and
loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann
noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor
implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs),
which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete
eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work
presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across
all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs
experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations
based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and
experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and
validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also
introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs
beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods
unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of
robust TPD-enhanced sensors.

Result: 噪声降低42.30%，量子比特需求减少40%。

Conclusion: 动态分区和混合执行有效提升NISQ设备的实用性，为大规模量子计算提供可行方案。

Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for
a range of computational problems. The fundamental mechanisms underlying
quantum computation required the development and construction of quantum
computers. These devices are referred to as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum) devices. Not only are NISQ devices extremely limited in their qubit
count but they also suffer from noise during computation and this problem only
gets worse as the size of the circuit increases which limits the practical use
of quantum computers for modern day applications. This paper will focus on
utilizing quantum circuit partitioning to overcome the inherent issues of NISQ
devices. Partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits has allowed
for the execution of quantum circuits that are too large to fit on one quantum
device. There have been many previous approaches to quantum circuit
partitioning and each of these approaches differ in how they work with some
focusing on hardware-aware partitioning, optimal graph-based partitioning,
multi-processor architectures and many more. These approaches achieve success
in their objective but they often fail to scale well which impacts cost and
noise. The ultimate goal of this paper is to mitigate these issues by
minimizing 3 important metrics; noise, time and cost. To achieve this we use
dynamic partitioning for practical circuit cutting and we take advantage of the
benefits of hybrid execution where classical computation will be used alongside
quantum hardware. This approach has proved to be beneficial with respect to
noise with classical execution enabling a 42.30% reduction in noise and a 40%
reduction in the number of qubits required in cases where a mixture of
classical and quantum computation were required.

Abstract: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is a strong and readily accessible optical
nonlinearity enabling a wide array of applications and research directions. For
instance, the three-wave mixing process has been employed to great success for
narrow-linewidth lasers, sensing applications, microscopy, and signal
processing. While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation,
there is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering
mechanism's significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at
low temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in
standard single-mode telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin
temperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne
detection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK
to 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid
helium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin
temperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interaction with
microscopic defects of the amorphous material - two-level-systems (TLS) - which
has not been previously observed in optical fiber. The measured behaviour of
the linewidth with temperature is in agreement with well-established models of
ultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic
scattering, thermally-activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS
interaction. This work provides a foundation for a wide range of applications
and further research including sensing applications, new approaches to
investigate TLS physics, and Brillouin-scattering-based quantum science and
technology.

Abstract: We explore the ground state phase diagram and nonequilibrium dynamics of
genuine two-component particle-imbalanced droplets in both isotropic and
anisotropic three-dimensional confinements. A gradual transition from mixed
droplet-gas to gas configurations is revealed as the average intercomponent
attraction decreases or the transverse confinement becomes tighter. Within the
mixed structures, a specific majority fragment binds to the minority droplet,
satisfying the density ratio locking condition, while the remaining atoms are
in a gas state. Our extended Gross-Pitaevskii numerical results are
corroborated by a suitable variational approximation capturing the shape and
characteristics of droplet-gas fragments. The tunability of the relatively low
gas fraction is showcased through parametric variations of the atom number, the
intercomponent imbalance, the trap aspect ratio, or the radius of a box
potential. To validate the existence and probe the properties of these exotic
phases, we simulate the standard time-of-flight and radio frequency
experimental techniques. These allow to dynamically identify the resilience of
the droplet fragment and the expansion of the gas fraction. Our results,
amenable to current experimental cold atom settings, are expected to guide
forthcoming investigations aiming to reveal unseen out-of-equilibrium droplet
dynamics.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对合成磁场和集体激发模式的理解，为量子技术应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: We systematically investigate the ground state and dynamics of spinor
Bose-Einstein condensates subject to a position-dependent detuning. This
detuning induces three related quantities-a synthetic magnetic field, an
angular velocity, and an angular momentum-which, due to trap anisotropy, may
point in different directions. When the dipole frequencies along the three
symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can
decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the
synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling
controllable Foucault-like precession or bi-conical trajectories depending on
the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the
synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop
a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii
simulations. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of
the synthetic magnetic field and the excitations of the collective mode in
quantum fluids, providing a foundation for future developments in quantum
simulation and high-precision sensing technologies.

Abstract: Dynamic structure factor (DSF) is important for understanding excitations in
many-body physics; it reveals information about the spectral and spatial
correlations of fluctuations in quantum systems. Collective phenomena like
quantum phase transitions of ultracold atoms are addressed by harnessing
density fluctuations. Here, we calculate the DSF of a nonequilibrium spinless
Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) from the perspective of dissipative phase transition
(DPT) in a steady state. Our methodology uses a homogeneous mean-field
approximation to make the single-site hierarchy simpler and applies the
Lindbladian perturbation method (LPM) to go beyond the single site, limited by
the ratio of the inter-site hopping term to the Liouvillian gap as a small
parameter. Our results show that the DSF near a DPT point is characteristically
different from that away from the transition point, providing a clear density
spectral signature of the DPT. In addition to comparing the two numerical
frameworks, the mean-field results serve as a benchmark for proof-of-principle
robustness of LPM. Despite the numerical difficulty, our methodology provides a
computationally accessible route for studying density fluctuations in an open
lattice quantum system without requiring large-scale computation.

Abstract: Additional hopping channels in a tight-binding lattice is known to introduce
faster dynamics of a quantum mechanical particle. However, we show that in the
case of a repulsively bound state, the dynamics becomes abnormally slow when
next-nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping is allowed for the particles. We show that
such slowing down occurs for some magic strength of the NNN hopping at which
the bound state band exhibits a quasi-flatband feature. We reveal this
anomalous dynamical behavior by analyzing the quench dynamics of two nearest
neighbor (NN) spin excitations (magnons) on a ferromagnetic chain by allowing
both NN and NNN couplings. By implementing digital quantum computing
simulations on a NISQ device, we obtain such non-trivial signatures and
complement the results with exact numerical calculations. Moreover, through
perturbative arguments, we reveal that the slowing down is due to the
destructive interference between different paths associated to the bound state
dynamics.
