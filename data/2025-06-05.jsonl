Here, we demonstrate that a\nnonlinear coupler, exemplified by a transmon, undergoes ionization under strong\nparametric driving, leading to a breakdown of coherent control and thereby\nlimiting the accessible gate speeds.

In\nthis work, we propose a new non-local unitary circuit to encode a surface code\nstate based on a code conversion between rotated and regular surface codes,\nwhich halves the gate count of the fastest encoder known previously. While the\nunitary encoders can be used to increase the code distance, the fault-distance\nremains fixed. Nonetheless, they can be used for space-time efficient\nrealization of eigenstates of the surface code operators that can't be easily\naccessed transversally such as the Pauli Y-eignestate and Clifford eigenstates.\nIt may be expected that error propagation in the non-local circuit will make\ndecoding more challenging compared to local unitary encoding circuits. However,\nwe find this not to be the case and that conventional matching decoders can be\neffectively used. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to benchmark\nthe performance of our encoder against a previous local unitary encoder and the\nconventional stabilizer-measurement based encoder for preparing the Pauli\nY-eigenstate and find that our encoder can outperform these in experimentally\nrelevant noise regimes.

The ionization\npotential extracted for both series from the modified Ritz formula agrees with\nour measurements based on the S and D series. Fine-structure intervals are\ncalculated and parameterized. The wave functions computed for the energies from\nthe quantum defects are used to calculate transition dipole moments. We compare\nthe reduced electric-dipole matrix elements with available benchmarks and find\nagreement within the precision of those works. The scalar and tensor\npolarizabilities of the $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_J$ , $nD_J$ and $nF_J$ series are\ncalculated based on the now more accurate set of wave functions. Moreover, we\nreport the polarizability as a series in powers of the effective principal\nquantum number and find the main coefficients of the expansion. The results\nwill be useful for calculating properties of $^{133}$Cs such as collision and\ndecay rates, polarizabilities, and magic wavelengths."}

Our central object is the Lipschitz cost\nmeasure, a transportation-inspired quantity that evaluates the minimal cost\nrequired to move between quantum states via a given channel. Accompanying this\nis the Lipschitz contraction coefficient, which captures how much the channel\ncontracts the Wasserstein-type distance between states. We establish\nfoundational properties of these quantities, including continuity, dual\nformulations, and behavior under composition and tensorization. Applications\ninclude recovery of several mathematical quantities including expected group\nword length and Carnot-Carath\\'eodory distance, via transportation cost.\nMoreover, we show that if the Lipschitz contraction coefficient is strictly\nless than one, one can get entropy contraction and mixing time estimates for\ncertain classes of non-symmetric channels."}

The\ngeneralization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however,\nremains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental\nprinciples. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three\naxioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations,\nand ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed\npoints; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed\npoint to an equivalence class, i.e. a phase, presenting the first step towards\nthe axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: \\emph{mixed-state\nbootstrap program}.\n  From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges. For\nexample, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable\nclassical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to\ntopological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing\none to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing\nconstraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that\nlooks purely classical -- demands a specific coordination among spatial\nsubregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates\nfrom non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally,\nwe performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability-weakly\ndecohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results\nlay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in\nopen quantum systems."}
