### [1] [Photon Antibunching from Superposed Squeezed Vacua via Quantum Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06397)
*Arash Azizi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文展示了通过量子叠加两个单模压缩真空态，可以实现光子反聚束（$g^{(2)}(0) < 1$），突破了传统高斯压缩真空态的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯压缩真空态通常表现为光子聚束（$g^{(2)}(0) > 1$），而光子反聚束是量子技术中的关键特性。本文旨在探索如何通过量子叠加实现光子反聚束。

Method: 通过理论分析和解析推导第二阶相干度$g^{(2)}(0)$，研究了两个非正交压缩态的量子干涉效应。

Result: 研究发现，量子干涉可以精确调控光子统计，实现$g^{(2)}(0)$低至0.567，突破了单个压缩态的限制。

Conclusion: 这一结果为光量子态的工程控制提供了新维度，对量子信息处理、精密测量和非经典光学场的理解具有重要意义。

Abstract: Photon antibunching ($g^{(2)}(0) < 1$), a hallmark of nonclassical light
crucial for quantum technologies, is typically absent in Gaussian squeezed
vacuum states, which inherently exhibit photon bunching ($g^{(2)}(0) > 1$). We
theoretically demonstrate that quantum superpositions of two single-mode
squeezed vacuum states with equal squeezing can, counterintuitively, lead to
strong photon antibunching. By analytically deriving the second-order coherence
$g^{(2)}(0)$, we show that quantum interference between the non-orthogonal
squeezed components allows for precise tuning of photon statistics into regimes
forbidden to individual squeezed states, achieving a minimum $g^{(2)}$ value as
low as $0.567$. Our results highlight a new dimension of quantum control in
engineered states of light, with implications for quantum information
processing, precision metrology, and the foundational understanding of
nonclassicality in optical fields.

### [2] [Comment on 'Time Crystals Made of Electron-Positron Pairs': Parity Considerations and Numerical Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06408)
*Zhen-Hua Feng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文指出一篇重要研究中的不一致性，并提出了一种新的变换方法以解决对称性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现原研究中的函数对称性与方程描述不符，且变换推导缺乏物理依据，需改进。

Method: 通过数值分析验证不一致性，并提出一种新的变换方法以正确体现对称性。

Result: 新方法不仅解决了原研究的不一致性，还提升了物理框架的连贯性。

Conclusion: 新变换方法改进了原研究的不足，增强了物理一致性。

Abstract: In this work, we critically examine the established findings of a seminal
study [arXiv:2105.04346], noting a significant discrepancy: Figures F9-F11
suggest that functions $\phi_1(y)$ and $\phi_2(y)$ exhibit parity (even/odd
symmetry), while Equation (21) fails to reflect this property. Our numerical
analyses substantiate this inconsistency. Additionally, we observe that the
derivation of Transformation (20) lacks sufficient physical grounding, which
warrants further scrutiny. In light of these observations, we introduce a novel
transformation that properly incorporates parity symmetry. This new approach
not only resolves the identified inconsistencies but also enhances the overall
physical coherence of the framework, building upon the foundational
contributions of the original work.

### [3] [Scalable Simulation of Fermionic Encoding Performance on Noisy Quantum Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06425)
*Emiliia Dyrenkova,Raymond Laflamme,Michael Vasmer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了量子计算机模拟费米子系统的编码方法，比较了Jordan-Wigner编码与Derby-Klassen编码的性能，发现后者的高采样需求限制了其近期应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 费米子系统的模拟具有实际应用价值，但现有编码方法如Jordan-Wigner存在效率问题，需探索更优的局部编码方法。

Method: 使用高性能稳定子模拟器，对Derby-Klassen编码进行经典模拟，并与Jordan-Wigner编码及三元树编码比较。

Result: 模拟显示，Derby-Klassen编码的高采样需求限制了其在近期量子设备中的应用。

Conclusion: 需进一步优化编码专用电路，以提升Derby-Klassen编码的实用性。

Abstract: A compelling application of quantum computers with thousands of qubits is
quantum simulation. Simulating fermionic systems is both a problem with clear
real-world applications and a computationally challenging task. In order to
simulate a system of fermions on a quantum computer, one has to first map the
fermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian. The most popular such mapping is
the Jordan-Wigner encoding, which suffers from inefficiencies caused by the
high weight of some encoded operators. As a result, alternative local encodings
have been proposed that solve this problem at the expense of a constant factor
increase in the number of qubits required. Some such encodings possess local
stabilizers, i.e., Pauli operators that act as the logical identity on the
encoded fermionic modes. A natural error mitigation approach in these cases is
to measure the stabilizers and discard any run where a measurement returns a -1
outcome. Using a high-performance stabilizer simulator, we classically simulate
the performance of a local encoding known as the Derby-Klassen encoding and
compare its performance with the Jordan-Wigner encoding and the ternary tree
encoding. Our simulations use more complex error models and significantly
larger system sizes (up to $18\times18$) than in previous work. We find that
the high sampling requirements of postselection methods with the Derby-Klassen
encoding pose a limitation to its applicability in near-term devices and call
for more encoding-specific circuit optimizations.

Result: 平均成功概率达到99.77±0.05%，优于原始算法。

Conclusion: 确定性Grover算法在实际应用中表现优异，且对技术缺陷更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Grover's algorithm is one of the pioneering demonstrations of the advantages
of quantum computing over its classical counterpart, providing - at most - a
quadratic speed-up over the classical solution for unstructured database
search. The original formulation of Grover's algorithm is non-deterministic,
finding the answer with a probability that varies with the size of the search
space and the number of marked elements. A recent reformulation introduced a
deterministic form of Grover's algorithm that - in principle - finds the answer
with certainty. Here we realise the deterministic Grover's algorithm on a
programmable photonic integrated circuit, finding that it not only outperforms
the original Grover's algorithm as predicted, but is also markedly more robust
against technological imperfections. We explore databases of 4 to 10 elements,
with every choice of a single marked element, achieving an average success
probability of $99.77 \pm 0.05\%$.

### [5] [Direct Polarization-Entangled Photon Pair Generation Using Domain-Engineered Nonlinear Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06460)
*Anatoly Shukhin,Inbar Hurvitz,Leonid Vidro,Ady Arie,Hagai S. Eisenberg*

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 利用单程SPDC和二向色（或偏振）分束器，通过量子态层析和联合光谱强度对称性量化两种方法表征纠缠源。

Result: 偏振纠缠源违反CHSH不等式（S=2.747±0.004），并在两个相互无偏的偏振基中测量了纠缠可见度。

Conclusion: 该配置易于实现且性能优越，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: A bi-photon polarization-frequency entanglement source was realized by
shaping the phase-matching function of a poled KTP crystal. It provides a
simple method to achieve either polarization or spectral entanglement in a
simple collinear setup, based on single-pass SPDC and a dichroic (or
polarizing) beam splitter. This is a robust and cost-effective configuration
that can be easily implemented outside the laboratory environment. We
characterized the source by two approaches: reconstructing the density matrix
of the generated state with quantum state tomography, by recording the
coincidences across 16 mutual polarization settings, in addition to a new
method based on quantifying the symmetry of the joint spectral intensity by
swapping between the signal and idler wavelengths. The polarization-entangled
source violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with a measured
$S=2.747\pm 0.004$. We also measured the polarization entanglement visibility
in two mutually unbiased polarization bases and evaluated the squeezing level
by characterizing the reduction in visibility at high pump power.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在区分正交纠缠态时导致纠缠完全消失的问题。

Result: 协议在保持每一步有限纠缠的同时，区分成功概率可接近1。

Conclusion: 该协议在区分正交纠缠态时能有效保留纠缠，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Two pure orthogonal quantum states can be perfectly distinguished by
sequential local action of multiple pairs of parties. However, this process
typically leads to the complete dissolution of entanglement in the states being
discriminated. We propose a protocol that allows an arbitrary number of pairs
of parties to distinguish between any two orthogonal, entangled, two-qubit pure
states using local quantum operations and classical communication, with a
success probability greater than that of random guessing, while ensuring that
at each step, the individual ensemble states retain a finite amount of
entanglement. Our protocol employs the minimum-error state discrimination
approach. For demonstrating the retention of entanglement in the ensemble
states at each step, we use logarithmic negativity as well as the concept of
entanglement witnessing. For a large family of sets of the two states, the
success probability of discrimination can be as close as required to unity,
while sustaining a finite amount of entanglement in each step.

### [7] [Classical analog circuit emulation of quantum Grover search algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06502)

Conclusion: 该模拟器可作为量子计算机的组件，适用于少量量子比特或可分块处理的任务。

Abstract: We construct a completely analog framework that emulates universal quantum
gates and quantum algorithms. It is based on electronic circuits made of
operational amplifiers, resistors and capacitors. In these circuits, input and
output lines represent the computational basis states (CBSs) and thus $2^n$
lines are required to represent $n$ qubits. An operation of the circuits is
based on classical evolution and interference of complex amplitudes associated
with each CBS. The framework can emulate entangled states and is free from
decoherence, measurements are classical and do not collapse states. Similar to
physical quantum computers, emulated quantum algorithms can be constructed as a
sequence of the gates belonging to a universal set (phase shift, Hadamard,
controlled-NOT), as a unitary matrix and as combinations of the two. Circuits
representing the universal gates have been made and tested. We also have made a
matrix-based emulator of a 3-qubit Grover search algorithm. We tested it by
searching for one and two particular states with one and two iterations and
found that its outputs accurately match predicted values. We anticipate that
the emulators can work as sub-components of physical quantum computers. On
their own, the emulators can be used for operations that require a few qubits
or operations that can be split into independent (and perhaps weakly entangled)
blocks of qubits.

### [8] [On Quantum Random Walks in Biomolecular Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06514)
*Viacheslav Dubovitskii,Aritra Bose,Filippo Utro,Laxmi Pardia*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了量子随机游走（QRWs）在生物分子网络分析中的潜力，相比经典方法，QRWs在疾病相关基因排序和关键驱动基因识别上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物分子网络的高维性、异质性和稀疏性对分析提出挑战，经典随机游走方法存在局限性，需要探索更高效的方法。

Method: 研究比较了经典随机游走和量子随机游走在基因-基因互作网络和细胞-细胞互作网络中的应用。

Result: QRWs在哮喘、自闭症和精神分裂症相关网络中更准确排序疾病基因，并在小鼠棕色脂肪组织网络中识别出经典方法忽略的关键驱动基因。

Conclusion: 量子随机游走对网络结构更敏感，能更有效地识别生物学相关特征，有望推动网络医学和系统生物学的发展。

Abstract: Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene
associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the
complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to
understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying
therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high
dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk
algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules,
helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological
pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random
walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular
network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in
a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and
schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to
classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction
network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes
in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings
suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical
approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better
performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights
their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.

Conclusion: 研究为控制扭曲物质束及其不稳定性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) wave packets, known for their vortex structure and
nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), are of great interest in various
scientific fields. Here we study the nonrelativistic dynamics of a
spatially-localized electron LG wave packet interacting with an inhomogeneous
external electric field that violates the axial symmetry of the initial wave
function. We focus on the analysis of the electron density and demonstrate how
it is affected by the external field. Within the first order of perturbation
theory, we calculate the electron wave function and reveal that the electric
field may significantly alter the wave packet's structure and distort its
qualitative form. We demonstrate that due to the interaction with the external
field, the degenerate zeros of the initial wave function located on the $z$
axis split into multiple nondegenerate nodes in the transverse plane
representing separate single-charge vortices. This mechanism resembles the
analogous effects known in topological optics. These findings provide new
insights into controlling and manipulating twisted matter beams and into their
possible instabilities.

Abstract: We develop machine learning models for the automated characterization of
quantum noise spectroscopy for non-Hermitian two-level systems. We use the
Random Forest, Support Vector and Feed-Forward Neural Network regression
algorithms to perform a highly accurate regression of the two-level system-bath
coupling strength. High accuracy Ohmicity classification was implemented to
provide a complete characterization of the spectral density function. We define
a time-averaged trace-distance metric to feed the machine learning algorithms
which, together with numerically exact populations as inputs, produce a highly
accurate non-Markovian regression spanning the transition from fast to slow
baths and from weak to strong coupling regimes of the interaction. The dynamics
database of the non-Hermitian systems has been built up within the independent
spin-boson and pure dephasing model.

Result: 存储时间提高三个数量级，腔的使用显著增加了读写带宽。

Conclusion: 该方法为波长转换、OAM转导和非破坏性读取提供了新途径。

Abstract: We theoretically propose a photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) quantum
memory platform based on an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring
trap and placed inside a Fabry-Perot cavity driven by Laguerre-Gaussian beams.
In contrast to electromagnetically induced transparency-based protocols, our
memory does not require change of internal atomic levels. The optical states
are instead stored in the large Hilbert space of topologically protected and
long-lived motional states (persistent currents) of the condensate, yielding a
storage time three orders of magnitude better than presently available.
Further, the use of a cavity provides orders of magnitude more resonances, and
hence bandwidth, for reading and writing than internal atomic transitions.
Finally, the analogy to cavity optomechanics suggests a natural path to
wavelength conversion, OAM transduction, and nondestructive readout of the
memory.

Abstract: Achieving robust and scalable remote quantum entanglement is a fundamental
challenge for the development of distributed quantum networks and modular
quantum computing systems. Along this, perfect state transfer (PST) and
fractional state transfer (FST) have emerged as promising schemes for quantum
state transfer and remote entanglement generation using only nearest-neighbor
couplings. However, the current implementations suffer from quantum loss and
limited parameter tunability. In this work, we propose a new quantum state
transfer scheme based on a zig-zag configuration, which introduces a
controlling parameter for PST and FST. We show that this new parameter can
suppress the population in the intermediate qubits, thereby reducing losses. We
experimentally demonstrate the dynamics of different configurations on a
superconducting quantum processor, achieving an $18\%$ reduction in error for
remote Bell state generation in a 1D ($1\times5$) qubit chain, and exhibit
robustness against certain types of noise. Then we extend our approach to a 2D
network, successfully generating a W state among the four corner qubits. These
results highlight the potential of our enhanced quantum state transfer scheme
for scalable and noise-resilient quantum communication and computing.

Abstract: Learning many-body quantum states and quantum phase transitions remains a
major challenge in quantum many-body physics. Classical machine learning
methods offer certain advantages in addressing these difficulties. In this
work, we propose a novel framework that bypasses the need to measure physical
observables by directly learning the parameters of parameterized quantum
circuits. By integrating the attention mechanism from large language models
(LLMs) with a variational autoencoder (VAE), we efficiently capture hidden
correlations within the circuit parameters. These correlations allow us to
extract information about quantum phase transitions in an unsupervised manner.
Moreover, our VAE acts as a classical representation of parameterized quantum
circuits and the corresponding many-body quantum states, enabling the efficient
generation of quantum states associated with specific phases. We apply our
framework to a variety of quantum systems and demonstrate its broad
applicability, with particularly strong performance in identifying topological
quantum phase transitions.

including quantum communication, computation, and sensing. Finally, we provide
a comparison across the three platforms, along with an outlook on future
directions and potential challenges.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework in the form of a Python package,
specifically designed for the analysis of Quantum Machine Learning models. This
framework is based on the PennyLane simulator and facilitates the evaluation
and training of Variational Quantum Circuits. It provides additional
functionality ranging from the ability to add different types of noise to the
classical simulation, over different parameter initialisation strategies, to
the calculation of expressibility and entanglement for a given model. As an
intrinsic property of Quantum Fourier Models, it provides two methods for
calculating the corresponding Fourier spectrum: one via the Fast Fourier
Transform and another analytical method based on the expansion of the
expectation value using trigonometric polynomials. It also provides a set of
predefined approaches that allow a fast and straightforward implementation of
Quantum Machine Learning models. With this framework, we extend the PennyLane
simulator with a set of tools that allow researchers a more convenient start

Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic
problem in quantum information theory. The optimality criterion recently
obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to
nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete
relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis
of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular
equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically
substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy
inequalities are proposed. We prove these inequalities in the cases of state
ensembles corresponding to acute or flat pyramids, thus providing the proof of
the hypothesis concerning the globally information-optimal observable.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的SAT编码方法，用于量子电路布局合成，重点优化电路深度或CX门深度，相比现有方法速度提升10-100倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子硬件平台对CX门的连接性有限制，且CX门噪声较大，因此需要优化电路布局以减少CX门数量或深度。

Method: 采用增量SAT求解和并行计划，提出一种新的SAT编码方法，保证找到深度或CX门深度最小的映射电路。

Result: 新方法比OLSQ2快10-100倍，但优化深度仍比优化门数量耗时。实验表明，同时优化CX门数量和深度能最好地降低噪声。

Conclusion: 优化CX门数量比优化深度更能降低噪声，但综合考虑两者效果最佳。

Abstract: Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware
platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout
Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be
executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or
CX depth of the mapped circuits.
  We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis
in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our
encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit
depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel
plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x
compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth
still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.
  We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after
(CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count
correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However,
taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise
reduction.

Motivation: 量子电路的设计和优化是量子算法发展的关键，但QAS方法的比较和评估缺乏统一标准且资源消耗高。

Method: 提出SQuASH基准，通过代理模型加速QAS方法的评估，并提供数据集和代码支持。

Result: SQuASH能够显著加速QAS方法的执行和比较，并支持快速原型设计。

Conclusion: SQuASH为QAS研究提供了高效、统一的评估工具，促进了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: The development of quantum algorithms and their practical applications
currently relies heavily on the efficient design, compilation, and optimization
of quantum circuits. In particular, parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), which
serve as the basis for variational quantum algorithms~(VQAs), demand carefully
engineered architectures that balance performance with hardware constraints.
Despite recent progress, identifying structural features of PQCs that enhance
trainability, noise resilience, and overall algorithmic performance remains an
active area of research. Addressing these challenges, quantum architecture
search (QAS) aims to automate the design of problem-specific PQCs by
systematically exploring circuit architectures to optimize algorithmic
performance, often with varying degrees of consideration for hardware
constraints. However, comparing QAS methods is challenging due to the absence
of a unified benchmark evaluation pipeline, and the high resource demands. In
this paper, we present SQuASH, the Surrogate Quantum Architecture Search
Helper, a benchmark that leverages surrogate models to enable uniform
comparison of QAS methods and considerably accelerate their evaluation. We
present the methodology for creating a surrogate benchmark for QAS and
demonstrate its capability to accelerate the execution and comparison of QAS
methods. Additionally, we provide the code required to integrate SQuASH into
custom QAS methods, enabling not only benchmarking but also the use of
surrogate models for rapid prototyping. We further release the dataset used to
train the surrogate models, facilitating reproducibility and further research.

Conclusion: 提出的优化框架有效且鲁棒，显著提升了QAOA参数选择的效率和质量。

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent
variational algorithm used for solving combinatorial optimization problems such
as the Max-Cut problem. A key challenge in QAOA lies in efficiently identifying
suitable parameters (gamma, beta) that lead to high-quality solutions. In this
paper, we propose a framework that combines Fully Informed Particle Swarm
Optimization (FIPSO) with adaptive gradient correction using the Adam Optimizer
to navigate the QAOA parameter space. This approach aims to avoid issues such
as barren plateaus and convergence to local minima. The proposed algorithm is
evaluated against two classes of graph instances, Erdos Renyi and
Watts-Strogatz. Experimental results across multiple QAOA depths consistently
demonstrate superior performance compared to random initialization,
underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization
framework.

TL;DR: 研究了$d\times d$ Hermitian矩阵集$M$作为偏序集的性质，定义了累积性概念，并将其与拓扑结构关联，证明了$M$是$T_0$空间，密度矩阵子集$\mathfrak{D}$是Hausdorff完全不连通空间。这些结果为量子Choquet积分提供了理论基础，并应用于求解给定期望值的密度矩阵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Hermitian矩阵集在偏序和拓扑结构下的性质，为量子Choquet积分提供数学基础，并解决非对易可观测量的期望值问题。

Method: 将Hermitian矩阵集$M$视为偏序集和拓扑空间，研究其累积性、$T_0$和Hausdorff性质，并利用容量和Möbius变换构造量子Choquet积分。

Result: 证明了$M$是$T_0$空间，$\mathfrak{D}$是Hausdorff完全不连通空间，并成功应用量子Choquet积分求解密度矩阵。

Conclusion: 为量子Choquet积分提供了理论框架，并展示了其在非对易可观测问题中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The set $M$ of $d\times d$ Hermitian matrices (observables) is studied as a
partially ordered set with the L\"{o}wner partial order. Upper and lower sets
in it, define the concept of cumulativeness (used mainly with scalar
quantities) in the context of Hermitian matrices. Partial order and topology
are intimately related to each other and the set $M$ of Hermitian matrices is
also studied as a topological space, where open and closed sets are the upper
and lower sets. It is shown that the set $M$ of Hermitian matrices is a $T_0$
topological space, and its subset ${\mathfrak D}$ of density matrices is
Hausdorff totally disconnected topological space. These ideas are a
prerequisite for studying quantum Choquet integrals with Hermitian matrices (as
opposed to classical Choquet integrals with scalar quantities). Capacities
(non-additive probabilities), cumulative quantities that involve Hermitian
matrices, and M\"obius transforms that remove the overlaps between
non-commuting observables, are used in quantum Choquet integrals. An
application of the formalism is to find a density matrix, with given
expectation values with respect to $n$ (non-commuting) observables. Examples of
calculations of such a density matrix (with quantified errors in its
expectation values), are presented.

Motivation: 量子计算的优势尚不明确，尤其是Hadamard门在经典可逆门集合中的作用未被完全描述。

Method: 扩展经典可逆编程语言Π，加入Hadamard门，并设计其范畴语义和等价性验证方法。

Result: 提出了一个有限表示和合成算法，用于描述正交矩阵群在环ℤ[1/√2]中的行为。

Conclusion: 该语言及其语义为量子程序的等价性验证提供了自动化工具，填补了理论空白。

Abstract: Quantum computing offers advantages over classical computation, yet the
precise features that set the two apart remain unclear. In the standard quantum
circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be
the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields
computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational
behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a
characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending
the universal classical reversible programming language $\Pi$ with a single
primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with
a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely
equational theory, enabling reasoning about the equivalence of quantum programs
in a way that can be automated. Completeness is shown by means of a novel
finite presentation, and corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of
orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 实验验证了在快速量子淬火中，Kibble-Zurek机制（KZM）的普适性会被打破，缺陷密度和冻结时间不再依赖于淬火速率，而是与淬火范围成普适比例关系。


<details>

Motivation: 挑战KZM机制在快速淬火条件下的普适性预测，验证理论提出的新标度关系。

Method: 使用单离子量子比特模拟Landau-Zener和1D Rice-Mele模型中的快速量子淬火，识别临界淬火速率v_c。

Result: 发现v_c与淬火范围δ_max相关，当v < v_c时缺陷密度遵循KZM标度，v > v_c时则与δ_max成普适比例。

Conclusion: 实验结果直接证实了快速淬火下KZM普适性的失效，支持理论预测的新标度行为。

Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts that when a system is driven
through a continuous phase transition, the density of topological defects
scales universally with the quench rate. Recent theoretical work [H.-B. Zeng
\textit{et al.}, \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} \textbf{130}, 060402 (2023)] has
challenged this picture, showing that under sufficiently fast quenches, both
the defect density and freezing time become independent of the quench rate and
instead scale universally with the quench range. Here, we experimentally test
this prediction using a single trapped-ion qubit to simulate fast quantum
quenches in the Landau-Zener and 1D Rice-Mele models. We identify a critical
quench rate \( v_c \) that scales with the quench range \( \delta_{\max} \),
separating two distinct dynamical regimes. In the Rice-Mele model, for \( v <
v_c \), the defect density follows the KZM scaling \( \sim v^{1/2} \); for \( v
> v_c \), it exhibits a universal scaling \( \sim \delta_{\max} \), independent
of the quench rate. Our results provide direct experimental evidence of the
predicted breakdown of KZM universality under fast quenches.

TL;DR: Fidelipart是一个新颖的量子电路分区框架，通过将电路转化为保真度感知的超图，结合门错误率和结构依赖性，显著减少了SWAP门和切割量子比特的数量，提升了电路保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ设备的高错误率和有限量子比特连接性导致标准分区启发式方法效果不佳，Fidelipart旨在通过考虑门错误影响优化分区。

Method: 将量子电路转化为保真度感知超图，利用门错误率和结构依赖性为节点和超边赋权，使用Mt-KaHyPar分区器最小化错误操作切割。

Result: 在6、10和24量子比特的基准测试中，Fidelipart显著减少了SWAP门（77.3%-100%）和切割量子比特（最多52.2%），保真度提升27.3%-250%。

Conclusion: Fidelipart通过集成详细的错误感知能力，显著提升了NISQ计算的可靠性，尽管运行时略有增加，但其保真度改进效果显著。

Abstract: Effective circuit partitioning is critical for Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are hampered by high error rates and limited
qubit connectivity. Standard partitioning heuristics often neglect
gate-specific error impacts, leading to suboptimal divisions with significant
communication overhead and reduced fidelity. This paper introduces Fidelipart,
a novel framework that transforms quantum circuits into a fidelity-aware
hypergraph. In this model, gate error rates and structural dependencies inform
the weights of nodes (gates) and hyperedges (representing multi-qubit
interactions and qubit timelines), guiding an Mt-KaHyPar partitioner to
minimize cuts through error-prone operations.
  We evaluated Fidelipart against BQSKit's QuickPartitioner on 6-qubit/22-gate,
10-qubit/55-gate, and 24-qubit/88-gate benchmarks under a linear topology with
a consistent local contiguous re-mapping strategy. Results demonstrate
Fidelipart's superior performance. It achieved SWAP gate reductions ranging
from 77.3% to 100% and up to a 52.2% decrease in cut qubits. These physical
improvements directly translated to estimated fidelity gains ranging from 27.3%
to over 250%. While Fidelipart showed a modest runtime increase of 8-13% and
variable effects on maximum partition depth, its substantial enhancement of
circuit fidelity highlights the significant benefits of integrating detailed
error-awareness into the partitioning process for more reliable NISQ
computations.

Result: Mermin五角星的10个三量子比特可观测量仅需约2.32位内存，而15个两量子比特Pauli可观测量至少需约2.58位内存。

Conclusion: 量子上下文关联的经典模拟内存需求因可观测量集合而异，某些情况下会超过系统的经典容量。

Abstract: Classically simulating the quantum contextual correlations produced by
sequences of ideal measurements of compatible observables requires the measured
system to have an internal memory. Computing the minimum amount of memory
needed is, in general, challenging. Here, building upon the work of Kleinmann
et al. [New J. Phys. 13, 113011 (2011)], we prove that the memory cost for
simulating the contextuality produced by the $10$ three-qubit observables of
Mermin's pentagram is only $\log_2(5) \approx 2.32$ bits, but the memory cost
for simulating the contextuality produced by all $15$ two-qubit Pauli
observables is, at least, $\log_2(6) \approx 2.58$ bits, thus exceeding the
classical capacity of the system on which the measurements are performed. We
also add results on the memory for simulating some subsets of quantum
predictions.

Conclusion: 研究结果扩展了孤子基CNOT模拟，支持非线性光学系统中多量子比特逻辑门经典模拟的可行性。

Abstract: We propose and numerically simulate an all-optical Toffoli
(controlled-controlled-NOT) gate based on the scattering of spatial solitons by
asymmetric P\"oschl-Teller potential wells. In our scheme, the logical state of
the target bit is encoded in the relative spatial ordering of two
distinguishable soliton components, while the control bits are represented by
the presence or absence of external potential wells. We solve the nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equations governing the soliton dynamics and systematically scan
soliton amplitude and velocity, analyzing reflection and transmission
coefficients to identify the operational conditions for Toffoli gate behavior.
Our results demonstrate that introducing asymmetry in the potential wells
significantly broadens the operational parameter window compared to symmetric
configurations. We also investigate the impacts of varying degrees of asymmetry
and soliton amplitude on gate performance. Furthermore, we examine the
influence of weak inter-component coupling and confirm that it is not essential
for gate operation. These findings generalize earlier soliton-based CNOT
simulations and support the broader feasibility of classical analog modeling of
multi-qubit logic gates in nonlinear optical systems.

Conclusion: 通过跨学科方法，本文成功连接了瓮模型与DTQW的应用范围，为两者提供了新的研究视角。

Abstract: Urn models have long been used to study stochastic processes, probability
distributions, and reinforcement dynamics. Meanwhile, discrete time quantum
walks (DTQW) serve as fundamental components in quantum computation and quantum
information theory. This work explores a novel connection between an urn model
and discrete-time quantum walks, focusing on how urn-based stochastic processes
can provide insights into quantum state evolution and algorithmic behavior.
Importantly, our model operates entirely with real-valued quantities, without
relying on complex amplitudes of the quantum walk. Every stochastic rule is
derived from urn-based processes, whose parameters are governed by the coin and
shift mechanisms of the quantum walk, maintaining the structural dynamics of
the DTQW. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to bridge classical
and quantum frameworks, offering new perspectives on both quantum algorithms
and stochastic modeling. This work connects the urn model to the broad range of
applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.

Abstract: Quantum transduction converts quantum states between different frequencies.
Similarly, quantum teleportation transfers quantum states between different
systems. While often appreciated for quantum communication between distant
locations, teleportation can also operate between different frequencies. In
terms of bosonic modes, quantum teleportation relies on two-mode squeezing --
squeezed on the balanced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) quadratures -- for
entanglement and a balanced beamsplitter plus homodyne detection for Bell
measurement. Since cross-frequency band entanglement is challenging to
generate, we propose to enable transduction with teleportation, while only
relying on a conventional transduction device and narrow-band entanglement. Our
insight is that a transduction device performs a cross-frequency-band
beamsplitter, almost what is needed in a Bell measurement, except that it is
often not balanced. We resolve the issue by proposing a generalized
teleportation protocol with arbitrarily unbalanced EPR quadratures and matched
unbalanced beamsplitters. The protocol can enhance quantum transduction, using
only off-the-shelf components -- intraband beamsplitters, offline squeezing,
homodyne detection and displacements. The proposed protocol achieves perfect
transduction when applying to a transduction device with an arbitrarily low
efficiency, at infinite squeezing. A minimum squeezing in the range of
[1.195,4.343] decibels is needed to achieve quantum capacity enhancement.

Result: 电磁势的规范不变部分足以解释Aharonov-Bohm相移，且具有物理实体性。

Conclusion: 电磁势不仅是数学工具，其规范不变部分具有物理意义，支持其在Aharonov-Bohm效应中的核心作用。

Abstract: The most popular interpretation of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is that the
electromagnetic potential locally affects the complex phase of a charged
particle's wave function in the magnetic field free region. However, since the
vector potential is a gauge-variant quantity, not a few researchers suspect
that it is just a convenient tool for calculating the force field. This
motivates them to explain the AB effect without using the vector potential,
which inevitably leads to some sort of non-locality. This frustrating situation
is shortly summarized by the statement of Aharonov et al. that the AB effect
may be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant
fields. In the present paper, we shall give several convincing arguments, which
support the viewpoint that the vector potential is not just a convenient
mathematical tool with little physical entity. Despite its gauge arbitrariness,
the vector potential certainly contains a gauge-invariant piece, which solely
explains the observed AB phase shift. Importantly, this component has a
property such that it is basically unique and cannot be eliminated by any
regular gauge transformations. To make the discussion complete, we also discuss
the role of remaining gauge arbitrariness still contained in the entire vector
potential.

Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are enabling
components of quantum photonic integrated circuits for their ease of
fabrication and unsurpassed performance. While several approaches for SNSPDs
integration are being pursued, scalability and interfacing with electrical
readout circuits remain challenging. Here we introduce the concept of inline
detection with SNSPDs, facilitating advanced quantum measurements within an
ultra-compact device footprint. To establish this approach, we develop a
photonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) platform based on etchless polymer
waveguides, which substantially suppress parasitic scattering at detector
terminations while ensuring compatibility with standard photonic substrates and
cryogenic operation. We show BIC-coupled inline detectors with on-chip
efficiency exceeding 80%, recovery time of less than 2 ns, and intrinsic jitter
of less than 70 ps. As a proof of principle, we implement a Hanbury Brown and
Twiss interferometer with footprint of 60x6 um2, and a photon number resolving
detector for discrimination of collinear photon pairs. The demonstration of
accurate and reliable inline quantum measurements within a simple and scalable
photonic architecture offers a viable pathway to realize more complex quantum
circuit functionalities, such as higher-order correlation measurements, quantum
state tomography, and multi-photon subtraction.

Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, emerging classical-quantum
hybrid optimization algorithms, such as variational quantum algorithms (VQAs),
can leverage the unique characteristics of quantum devices to accelerate
computations tailored to specific problems with shallow circuits. However,
these algorithms encounter biases and iteration difficulties due to significant
noise in quantum processors. These difficulties can only be partially addressed
without error correction by optimizing hardware, reducing circuit complexity,
or fitting and extrapolation. A compelling solution is applying probabilistic
error cancellation (PEC), a quantum error mitigation technique that enables
unbiased results without full error correction. Traditional PEC is challenging
to apply in VQAs due to its variance amplification, contradicting iterative
process assumptions. This paper proposes a novel noise-adaptable strategy that
combines PEC with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). It is
implemented through invariant sampling circuits (invariant-PEC, or IPEC) and
substantially reduces iteration variance. This strategy marks the first
successful integration of PEC and QAOA, resulting in efficient convergence.
Moreover, we introduce adaptive partial PEC (APPEC), which modulates the error
cancellation proportion of IPEC during iteration. We experimentally validated
this technique on a superconducting quantum processor, cutting sampling cost by
90.1\%. Notably, we find that dynamic adjustments of error levels via APPEC can
enhance escape from local minima and reduce sampling costs. These results open
promising avenues for executing VQAs with large-scale, low-noise quantum
circuits, paving the way for practical quantum computing advancements.

intensive resources and becomes infeasible on large-scale quantum devices.
Other methods have explored advanced strategies, yet challenges in experimental
feasibility and scalability persist. To address this issues, we introduce
influence sampling that efficiently extracts the key \textit{influence} of a
quantum process on qubit subsets using at most three distinct single-qubit test
gates. Using a photonic platform, we experimentally demonstrate influence
sampling and apply it to testing and learning quantum junta processes,
determining whether a process acts non-trivially on only a subset of qubits and
subsequently learning that process. In addition, we confirm the scalability of
influence sampling by deploying it in larger systems. These results establish
influence sampling as a powerful and scalable process characterization
technique, facilitating efficient device assessment and noisy qubit
identification.

instruments generated by a bipartite mixed state. Next we quantitatively
characterized the relations among the convex resource theories of distributed

we show that high-dimensional entanglement provides advantages in a state
discrimination game, and the advantages can be quantified by the Schmidt-number
robustness.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子约束满足问题的分类提供了新的复杂性类，并展示了新的高效可解问题类型，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Previously, all known variants of the Quantum Satisfiability (QSAT) problem,
i.e. deciding whether a $k$-local ($k$-body) Hamiltonian is frustration-free,
could be classified as being either in $\mathsf{P}$; or complete for
$\mathsf{NP}$, $\mathsf{MA}$, or $\mathsf{QMA_1}$. Here, we demonstrate new
qubit variants of this problem that are complete for $\mathsf{BQP_1}$,
$\mathsf{coRP}$, $\mathsf{QCMA}$, $\mathsf{PI(coRP,NP)}$,
$\mathsf{PI(BQP_1,NP)}$, $\mathsf{PI(BQP_1,MA)}$, $\mathsf{SoPU(coRP,NP)}$,
$\mathsf{SoPU(BQP_1,NP)}$, and $\mathsf{SoPU(BQP_1,MA)}$. Our result implies
that a complete classification of quantum constraint satisfaction problems
(QCSPs), analogous to Schaefer's dichotomy theorem for classical CSPs, must
either include these 13 classes, or otherwise show that some are equal.
Additionally, our result showcases two new types of QSAT problems that can be
decided efficiently, as well as the first nontrivial $\mathsf{BQP_1}$-complete
problem. We first prove there are qudit QSAT problems that are complete for
$\mathsf{BQP_1}$, $\mathsf{coRP}$, and $\mathsf{QCMA}$ by re-defining elements
of the circuit-to-Hamiltonian transformation. We then show that any QCSP can be
reduced to a problem in qubits while maintaining the same complexity -
something believed not to be possible classically. The remaining six problems
are obtained by considering "sums" and "products" of the first seven QSAT
problems. Before this work, the QSAT problems generated in this way resulted in
complete problems for $\mathsf{PI}$ and $\mathsf{SoPU}$ classes that were
trivially equal to other known classes. We thus commence the study of these new
and seemingly nontrivial classes. While [Meiburg, 2021] first sought to prove
completeness for the first three classes, we note that his constructions are
flawed. Here, we rework them and obtain improvements on the required qudit
dimensionality.

to provide a comprehensive review of the different strategies proposed and/or
experimentally realized to induce long-range interactions among atoms moving in
optical potentials. Second, to showcase various fields where such platforms can
offer new insights, ranging from the simulation of condensed matter phenomena
to the study of lattice gauge theories, and the simulation of electronic
configurations in chemistry. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities
of these platforms compared to other complementary approaches based on digital
simulation and quantum computation.

Abstract: In quantum information, quantum correlations--particularly entanglement, EPR
steering, and quantum discord--stand as interesting resources, powering
breakthroughs from secure communication and quantum teleportation to efficient
quantum computation. Here, we unveil a theoretical framework for generating and
controlling these vital quantum phenomena within a double-cavity molecular
optomechanical (McOM) system. This innovative approach leverages strong
interactions between confined optical fields and collective molecular
vibrations, creating a versatile environment for exploring robust quantum
correlations. Our findings reveal that judiciously optimizing the coupling
strength between the cavity field and the molecular collective mode leads to a
remarkable enhancement of entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord.
We demonstrate that cavity-cavity quantum correlations can be effectively
mediated by the molecular collective mode, enabling a unique pathway for
inter-cavity quantum connectivity. Moreover, the quantum entanglement generated
in our McOM system exhibits robustness against thermal noise, persisting at
temperatures approaching 1000 K. This strong resilience, qualifies molecular
optomechanics as a compelling architecture for scalable, room-temperature
quantum information processing and the practical realization of quantum
networks.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a promising framework for online
quantum-enhanced machine learning tailored to temporal tasks, yet practical
implementations with native memory capabilities remain limited. Here, we
demonstrate an optical QRC platform based on deterministically generated
multimode squeezed states, exploiting both spectral and temporal multiplexing
in a fully continuous-variable (CV) setting, and enabling controlled fading
memory. Data is encoded via programmable phase shaping of the pump in an
optical parametric process and retrieved through mode-selective homodyne
detection. Real-time memory is achieved through feedback using electro-optic
phase modulation, while long-term dependencies are achieved via spatial
multiplexing. This architecture with minimal post-processing performs nonlinear
temporal tasks, including parity checking and chaotic signal forecasting, with
results corroborated by a high-fidelity Digital Twin. We show that leveraging
the entangled multimode structure significantly enhances the expressivity and
memory capacity of the quantum reservoir. This work establishes a scalable
photonic platform for quantum machine learning, operating in CV encoding and
supporting practical quantum-enhanced information processing.

Conclusion: 在损失鲁棒性和量子优势之间存在权衡。

Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown that squeezed states
of light can be engineered to enhance the resolution of nonlinear optical
measurements. Here, we analyze non-degenerate two-photon absorption signals
obtained from transmission measurements using two-mode squeezed light and
compare different measurement strategies. In particular, we investigate how
correlations between the light modes may be used to improve the achievable
precision. We find that intensity correlation measurements offer the best
performance compared to normalized intensity correlation and noise reduction
factor approaches. Under experimental imperfections modeled as linear photon
losses, the enhancements from intensity and noise reduction measurements are
reduced. In contrast, the normalized intensity correlation remains robust to
loss, though this comes at the cost of losing the enhancement from
non-classical light fields. This establishes a trade-off between robustness to
loss and the achievable quantum advantage.

Abstract: Bell tests are of profound statistical nature. Besides physical

detailed statistical analyses. In this regard, recent works have shown that
their consequences and interpretations depend on the probability space adopted.
Some other recent works have also shown that generalized measurements may allow
to further exploit the statistics of Bell-like tests. Following these ideas, in
this work we show that one and the same experimental arrangement can provide a
practical scheme valid for two very different probability spaces. Moreover, we
show that this allows the introduction of novel Bell tests that are not
possible in more standard approaches.

Abstract: Deriving formulations for computing and estimating tight worst-case size
increases for conjunctive queries with various constraints has been at the core
of theoretical database research. If the problem has no constraints or only one
constraint, such as functional dependencies or degree constraints, tight
worst-case size bounds have been proven, and they are even practically
computable. If the problem has more than one constraint, computing tight bounds
can be difficult in practice and may even require an infinite number of linear
inequalities in its optimization formulation. While these challenges have been
addressed with varying methods, no prior research has employed quantum
information theory to address this problem. In this work, we establish a
connection between earlier work on estimating size bounds for conjunctive
queries with classical information theory and the field of quantum information
theory. We propose replacing the classical Shannon entropy formulation with the
quantum R\'enyi entropy. Whereas classical Shannon entropy requires infinitely
many inequalities to characterize the optimization space, R\'enyi entropy
requires only one type of inequality, which is non-negativity. Although this is
a promising modification, optimization with respect to the quantum states
instead of classical distributions creates a new set of challenges that prevent
us from finding a practically computable, tight worst-case size bound. In this
line, we propose a quantum version to derive worst-case size bounds. The
previous tight classical worst-case size bound can be viewed as a special limit
of this quantum bound. We also provide a comprehensive background on prior
research and discuss the future possibilities of quantum information theory in
theoretical database research.

Abstract: Metronome synchronization and the transition between the in-phase and
anti-phase synchronization have been observed in classical systems. We
demonstrate the quantum analog of this phenomenon in a two-qubit system coupled
to a common environment. Tracing out the environment in the quantum collision
model, we obtain an effective master equation with a two-body dissipator for
two qubits. Quenching the two-body dissipator, we demonstrate controlled
transitions from in-phase to anti-phase synchronization. This synchronization
transition is robust against noise. Signatures of the transition are observed
through Pearson correlation coefficient measurements obtained via quantum
simulations on superconducting circuits. Future experiments employing qutrit
systems are expected to yield a more pronounced effect.

Abstract: Quantum metrology stands as a leading application of quantum science and
technology, yet its precision and sensitivity are often constrained by noise.
In the context of near-term quantum metrology, quantum error mitigation offers
a promising strategy to leverage quantum resources. While existing
error-mitigated protocols largely depend on virtual state purification,
significant noise accumulation and the additional noise introduced by the noisy
implementations of these protocols can impede the effectiveness. To address
these problems, we propose probabilistic virtual channel purification to handle
the largely accumulated noise while efficiently canceling additional noise from
itself. This also naturally leads to an enhanced version of virtual state
purification, namely probabilistic virtual state purification. Within the
sequential scheme of quantum metrology, our error analysis reveals a
significant reduction in bias and a quantum advantage in sampling cost when the
number of channels encoding the interested parameters is $O(p^{-1})$, where $p$
is the error rate of the encoding channel. In this range, both probabilistic
virtual purification methods demonstrate significant improvements in parameter
estimation precision and robustness against practical noise, as evidenced by
numerical simulations for both single- and multi-parameter tasks.

Abstract: The necessity of complex numbers in quantum mechanics has long been debated.
This paper develops a real Kahler space formulation of quantum mechanics [19],
asserting equivalence to the standard complex Hilbert space framework. By
mapping the complex Hilbert space ${\mathbb C}^n$ to a real Kahler space $K
^{2n}$, i.e. ${\mathbb R}^{2n}$ equipped with a metric, a symplectic structure
and an automorphism, we establish a correspondence between Hermitian operators
in ${\mathbb C}^n$ and real operators in $K^{2n}$. While the isomorphism
appears straightforward some subtleties emerge: (i) the overcounting of
composite system states under tensor products in ${\mathbb R}^{2n}$, and (ii)
the double degeneracy of operator spectra in the real formulation. Through a
systematic investigation of these challenges, we clarify the structural
relationship between real and complex formulations, resolve ambiguities in
composite system representations, and analyze spectral consequences. Our
results reaffirm the equivalence of the two frameworks while highlighting
nuanced distinctions with implications for foundational debates on locality,
phase invariance, and the role of complex numbers in quantum theory.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems provide a fertile platform for quantum
technologies, owing in part to their distinct dynamical phases. These systems
can be characterized by the preservation or spontaneous breaking of parity-time
reversal symmetry, significantly impacting the dynamical behavior of quantum
resources such as entanglement and purity; resources which in turn govern the
system's information processing and memory capacity. Here we investigate this
relationship using the example of an interacting NH spin system defined on
random graphs. We show that the onset of the first exceptional point - marking
the real-to-complex spectral transition - also corresponds to an abrupt change
in the system's learning capacity. We further demonstrate that this transition
is controllable via local disorder and spin interactions strength, thereby
defining a tunable learnability threshold. Within the learning phase, the
system exhibits the key features required for memory-dependent reservoir
computing. This makes explicit a direct link between spectral structure and
computational capacity, further establishing non-Hermiticity, and more broadly
engineered dissipation, as a dynamic resource for temporal quantum machine
learning.

Conclusion: D-PSO是一种有效的相位测量优化方案，适用于SU(1,1)干涉仪。

Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to improve the precision of phase measurement
using intensity detection by implementing delocalized photon subtraction
operation (D-PSO) inside the SU(1,1) interferometer, with the coherent state
and the vacuum state as the input states. We compare the phase sensitivity and
the quantum Fisher information between D-PSO and localized photon subtraction
operation (L-PSO) under both ideal and photon-loss cases. It has been found
that the D-PSO can improve the measurement accuracy of the SU(1,1)
interferometer and enhance its robustness against internal photon loss. And it
can cover and even exceed the advantages of the L-PSO on two modes,
respectively. In addition, by comparing the standard quantum limit, the
Heisenberg limit and quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, we find that the phase
sensitivity of the D-PSO can get closer to the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound and
has the ability to resist internal loss.

Abstract: We consider communication scenarios with multiple senders and a single
receiver. Focusing on communication tasks where the distinguishability or
anti-distinguishability of the sender's input is bounded, we show that quantum
strategies without any shared entanglement can outperform the classical ones.
We introduce a systematic technique for deriving the facet inequalities that
delineate the polytope of classical correlations in such scenarios. As a proof
of principle, we recover the complete set of facet inequalities for some
non-trivial scenarios involving two senders and a receiver with no input.
Explicit quantum protocols are studied that violate these inequalities,
demonstrating quantum advantage. We further investigate the task of
anti-distinguishing the joint input string held by the senders and derive upper
bounds on the optimal classical success probability. Leveraging the Pusey
Barrett Rudolph theorem, we prove that when each sender has a binary input, the
quantum advantage grows with the number of senders. We also provide sufficient
conditions for quantum advantage for arbitrary input sizes and illustrate them
through several explicit examples.

Abstract: Identifying information tasks that offer advantages over their classical
counterparts by exploiting quantum resources finds the usefulness of quantum
information technologies. In this work, we introduce a two-party communication
primitive, Random Exclusion Code (REC), which is a single-shot
prepare-and-measure protocol where a sender encodes a random message into a
shorter sequence and a receiver attempts to exclude a randomly chosen letter in
the original message. We present quantum advantages in RECs in two ways:
probability and dimension. We show that RECs with quantum resources achieve
higher success probabilities than classical strategies. We verify that the
quantum resources required to describe detection events of RECs have a smaller
dimension than classical ones. We also show that a guessing counterpart, random

Abstract: Quantum sampling, a fundamental subroutine in numerous quantum algorithms,
involves encoding a given probability distribution in the amplitudes of a pure
state. Given the hefty cost of large-scale quantum storage, we initiate the
study of quantum sampling in a distributed setting. Specifically, we assume
that the data is distributed among multiple machines, and each machine solely
maintains a basic oracle that counts the multiplicity of individual elements.
Given a quantum sampling task, which is to sample from the joint database, a
coordinator can make oracle queries to all machines. We focus on the oblivious
communication model, where communications between the coordinator and the
machines are predetermined. We present both sequential and parallel algorithms:
the sequential algorithm queries the machines sequentially, while the parallel
algorithm allows the coordinator to query all machines simultaneously.
Furthermore, we prove that both algorithms are optimal in their respective
settings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了六方氮化硼（hBN）中表面电场噪声对自旋缺陷的影响，揭示了其深度相关的幂律依赖性，并探索了钝化材料（如甘油和PMMA）对噪声的抑制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: hBN自旋缺陷在量子传感中具有潜力，但其性能受限于快速相干性损失。虽然磁噪声机制已被广泛研究，但表面电场噪声的影响尚未在hBN系统中探索。

Method: 利用浅层硼空位缺陷系统研究hBN中的表面电场噪声，分析双量子自旋弛豫行为对磁场和缺陷深度的响应，并测试钝化材料的效果。

Result: 弛豫率与缺陷深度呈幂律依赖关系，且与缺陷浓度无关。温度升高（296 K至453 K）会导致弛豫率显著增加。PMMA比甘油更能有效抑制表面电场噪声。

Conclusion: 研究加深了对hBN中表面电场噪声的理解，为未来噪声抑制策略的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spin defects off er transformative potential
for quantum sensing through atomic-scale proximity to target samples, yet their
performance is fundamentally limited by rapid coherence loss. While magnetic
noise mechanisms have been extensively studied, another critical infl uence
from surface electric fi eld noise remains unexplored in hBN systems. Here,we
address this challenge and systematically investigate surface electric fi eld
noise in hBN using shallow boron vacancy defects. The double-quantum spin
relaxation behavior in response to magnetic fi elds and defect depths is
examined, revealing that the relaxation rate follows a distinctive
depth-related power-law dependence of ODMR splitting frequency. The relaxation
is also demonstrated to be independent of the defect concentrations.
Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate is investigated,
showing a noticeable rise as the temperature increases from 296 K to 453 K,
thus highlighting the infl uence of thermal eff ects on spin relaxation. To
further suppress surface electric fi eld noise, we explore the eff ectiveness
of passivation materials, including glycerol and PMMA. Notably, PMMA is more
effi cient in mitigating surface electric fi eld noise. These experiments
enhance the understanding of surface electric fi eld noise in hBN and provide a
foundation for developing noise mitigation strategies in future research.

Abstract: Superconducting inductors with impedance surpassing the resistance quantum,
i.e., superinductors, are important for quantum technologies because they
enable the development of protected qubits, enhance coupling to systems with
small electric dipole moments, and facilitate the study of phase-slip physics.
We demonstrate superinductors with densely packed meandered traces of granular
aluminum (grAl) with inductances up to $4\,\mu\mathrm{H}$, achieving impedances
exceeding $100\,\mathrm{k}\Omega$ in the $4-8\,\mathrm{GHz}$ range. Ring
resonators made with grAl meandered superinductors exhibit quality factors on
the order of $10^5$ in the single-photon regime and low non-linearity on the
order of tens of $\mathrm{Hz}$. Depending on the grAl resistivity, at
$10\,\mathrm{Hz}$, we measure frequency noise spectral densities in the range
of $10^2$ to $10^3\,\mathrm{Hz}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. In some devices, in the
single-photon regime, we observe a positive Kerr coefficient of unknown origin.
Using more complex fabrication, the devices could be released from the
substrate, either freestanding or suspended on a membrane, thereby further
improving their impedance by a factor of three.

Abstract: Gap-protected topological channels are a promising way to realize robust and
high-fidelity state transfer in quantum networks. Although various topological
transfer protocols based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model or its variants have
been proposed, the phase accumulation during the evolution, as an essential
aspect, is underestimated. Here, by numerically studying the phase information
of quantum state transfer (QST) in one-dimensional (1D) topological spin
chains, we uncover a universal phase correction $\phi_0 =(N-1)\pi/2$ for both
adiabatic and diabatic topological schemes. Interestingly, the
site-number-dependent phase correction satisfies $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ symmetry and
is equally effective for perfect mirror transmission in spin chains. Our work
reveals a universal phase correction in 1D topologically protected QST, which
will prompt a reevaluation of the topological protection mechanism in quantum
systems.

Conclusion: 实验支持量子理论中断层局部性原理的正确性，同时验证了分析方法的有效性。

Abstract: The principle of tomographic locality states that the operational state of a
multipartite system can be fully characterized by the statistics obtained from
measurements that are local to the individual subsystems. This property holds
in quantum theory and features prominently in axiomatic reconstructions of the
theory, where it serves to rule out a wide class of alternatives. For instance,
quantum theory with Hilbert spaces defined over the real field (rather than the
complex field) is an example of a theory that is ruled out in this fashion.
Given its foundational importance, it is worthwhile to subject this principle
to a direct experimental test. Specifically, we consider an experiment on the
polarization degrees of freedom of a pair of photonic modes in a
prepare-and-measure scenario and analyze the resulting data within the
framework of generalized probabilistic theories. The signature of a failure of
tomographic locality is that there are pairs of states on the bipartite system
that can only be distinguished by the statistics they yield for non-separable
measurements. In the full quantum setting, we find no evidence of a violation
of tomographic locality. As a test of our analysis method, we also verify that
if we restrict attention to those states and measurements that lie within the
fragment described by quantum theory over the real field, then a clear
signature of the failure of tomographic locality is observed.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a method for tuning a dissipation rate in an
atom-cavity system. By inserting a nanotip into the cavity mode, we estimate
that the cavity dissipation rate increases by a factor of approximately 20, due
to the scattering loss at the tip. As applications of our in-situ technique, we
demonstrate that an exceptional line can be obtained when a single atom or ion
is coupled to the resonator. Moreover, the position of an exceptional point is
tuned by adjusting the decay rate, enabling a topological transition through
dissipation control alone.

Abstract: Ensemble methods in machine learning aim to improve prediction accuracy by
combining multiple models. This is achieved by ensuring diversity among
predictors to capture different data aspects. Homogeneous ensembles use
identical models, achieving diversity through different data subsets, and
weighted-average ensembles assign higher influence to more accurate models
through a weight learning procedure. We propose a method to achieve a weighted
homogeneous quantum ensemble using quantum classifiers with indexing registers
for data encoding. This approach leverages instance-based quantum classifiers,
enabling feature and training point subsampling through superposition and
controlled unitaries, and allowing for a quantum-parallel execution of diverse
internal classifiers with different data compositions in superposition. The
method integrates a learning process involving circuit execution and classical
weight optimization, for a trained ensemble execution with weights encoded in
the circuit at test-time. Empirical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method, offering insights into its performance.

Abstract: Drone-based entanglement distribution provides full spatiotemporal coverage
for quantum networks, enabling quantum key distribution (QKD) in dynamic
environments. The security of QKD fundamentally depends on high-fidelity
quantum state measurements, for which high-precision clock synchronization is
indispensable, as timing jitter is inversely correlated with quantum state
fidelity. However, drone-based clock synchronization is constrained by SWaP
(Size, Weight, and Power) limitations and dynamic mobility effects. Here, we
propose a synchronization protocol for drone-based entanglement distribution,
leveraging nanosecond-accurate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) timing
and entanglement-based timing correction to overcome SWaP constraints.
Experimental results demonstrate 24 ps RMS synchronization in simulated
free-space quantum channels with distance dynamics, without requiring precision
reference clock. Our protocol enables drone-based entanglement distribution,
paving the way for seamless wide-area and local-area quantum internet.

we tackle protein folding on a tetrahedral lattice for up to 12 amino acids,
representing the largest quantum hardware implementations of protein folding
problems reported to date. Additionally, we address MAX 4-SAT instances at the
computational phase transition and fully connected spin-glass problems using
all 36 available qubits. Across all considered cases, our method consistently
achieves optimal solutions, highlighting the powerful synergy between
non-variational quantum optimization approaches and the intrinsic all-to-all

practical quantum advantage for dense HUBO problems with significant industrial

Abstract: The general framework of Entropic Dynamics (ED) is used to construct
non-relativistic models of relational quantum mechanics from well known
inference principles -- probability, entropy and information geometry. Although
only partially relational -- the absolute structures of simultaneity and
Euclidean geometry are still retained -- these models provide a useful testing
ground for ideas that will prove useful in the context of more realistic
relativistic theories. The fact that in ED the positions of particles have
definite values, just as in classical mechanics, has allowed us to adapt to the
quantum case some intuitions from Barbour and Bertotti's classical framework.
Here, however, we propose a new measure of the mismatch between successive
states that is adapted to the information metric and the symplectic structures
of the quantum phase space. We make explicit that ED is temporally relational
and we construct non-relativistic quantum models that are spatially relational
with respect to rigid translations and rotations. The ED approach settles the
longstanding question of what form should the constraints of a classical theory
take after quantization: the quantum constraints that express relationality are
to be imposed on expectation values. To highlight the potential impact of these
developments, the non-relativistic quantum model is parametrized into a
generally covariant form and we show that the ED approach evades the analogue
of what in quantum gravity has been called the problem of time.

Abstract: Telecom-wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution
for generating deterministic single-photons compatible with existing
fiber-optic infrastructure. Emission in the low-loss C-band minimizes
transmission losses, making them ideal for long-distance quantum communication.
In this work, we present the first demonstration of both Stark tuning and
charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom
C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in a InP-based
$n^{++}$--$i$--$n^{+}$ heterostructure, fabricated using MOVPE. The gated
architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined
Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control
over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic
states. Electrical tuning of the fine-structure splitting is further
demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom
wavelengths. The single-photon character is confirmed via second-order
correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance
with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step
toward scalable, fiber-compatible quantum photonic devices.

is shown how this can be interpreted as an evolving state in spacetime with

Abstract: Recovering both amplitude and phase information from a system is a
fundamental goal of optical imaging. At the same time, it is crucial to use a
low photon dose to avoid altering the system, particularly when dealing with
biological samples. Quantum imaging offers a powerful approach for extracting
more information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately
limited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction
and spatial resolution has been considered a major drawback to the application
of quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they
could offer the most significant benefits. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by demonstrating a resolution-independent quantum advantage. We
achieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture,
while simultaneously attaining quantum noise reduction. This enables, for the
first time, sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells.
Unlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a
quasi-single-shot wide-field mode, retrieves both phase and amplitude
information, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it
intrinsically fast and stable. These results pave the way for the immediate
application of sub-shot-noise imaging in biology.

Abstract: In sub-universal quantum platforms such as linear or Gaussian quantum optics,
quantum states can behave as different resources, in regard to the extent of
their accessible state space (called their orbit) under the action of the
restricted unitary group. We propose to study the dimension of a quantum
state's orbit (as a manifold in the Hilbert space), a simple yet nontrivial
topological property that can quantify "how many" states it can reach. As
natural invariants under the group, these structural properties of orbits alone
can reveal fundamental impossibilities of enacting certain unitary
transformations deterministically. We showcase a general and straightforward
way to compute orbit dimensions for states of finite support in the Fock basis,
by leveraging the group's Lie algebra. We also study genericity and robustness
properties of orbit dimensions, and propose approaches to efficiently evaluate
them experimentally. Besides, we highlight that the orbit dimension under the
Gaussian unitary group serves a non-Gaussianity witness, which we expect to be
universal for multimode pure states. While proven in the discrete variable
setting (i.e. passive linear optics with an energy cutoff), the validity of our
work in the continuous variable setting does rest on a technical conjecture
which we do not prove.

TL;DR: 量子机器学习通过量子图变换器（QGT）在结构化语言建模中实现高效和表达力强的模型，显著减少参数并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习在复杂结构化数据处理中具有潜力，QGT旨在结合量子自注意力机制提升语言模型的效率和表现力。

Method: QGT采用参数化量子电路（PQCs）实现量子自注意力机制，集成到图消息传递框架中，用于结构化语言建模。

Result: QGT在五个情感分类基准测试中表现优于或接近现有量子自然语言处理模型，相比经典图变换器平均提升5.42%（真实数据）和4.76%（合成数据）。

Conclusion: QGT展示了图基量子自然语言处理技术在高效和可扩展语言理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient
and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex,
structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

Method: 采用非相对论性、基于QED的时变框架，考虑拉比振荡、光电离、俄歇衰变及弹性散射与共振荧光路径的量子干涉。

Result: 共振散射产率更高，信号角分布类似双原子结构因子，干涉条纹可见度受脉冲面积和初始电子态影响，线性散射区干涉最明显。

Conclusion: 研究结果为超快共振X射线散射在单粒子成像中的应用提供了优化条件。

Abstract: We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two
non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a
non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi
oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among
elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the
total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and
initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield
exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal
qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of
interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic
state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence
exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon
emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering
regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be
largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for
applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.

TL;DR: 研究了空间退相干如何导致开放量子系统在长波长、晚期的流体动力学行为，通过非相对论量子粒子与热浴耦合的模型，推导出类似夸克-胶子等离子体的流体方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子系统中流体动力学行为的起源，尤其是在退相干和热浴耦合的背景下。

Method: 采用Caldeira-Leggett模型，将约化密度矩阵按空间非对角分量展开，截断至二阶，得到耗散流体方程。

Result: 推导出类似Navier-Stokes方程的流体动力学方程，输运系数由阻尼常数γ决定。

Conclusion: 为少自由度量子系统中流体动力学行为的出现提供了新视角。

Abstract: We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to
hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum
systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle
linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at
temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in
the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of
the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at
late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a
set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the
non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the
quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport
coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which
quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our
hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a
compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light
on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in quantum systems with few degrees of
freedom.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于有限复杂度预算的复杂性窗口热力学（CWT），解决了经典热力学奇异点问题，并揭示了信息处理功项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典热力学在相变和负温区域的奇异点源于等概率假设忽略了量子动力学复杂性。CWT旨在通过引入有限复杂度预算来正则化这些奇异点。

Method: 通过推广有限动力学复杂性为假设，提出窗口熵概念，并推导出广义第一定律和动作-时间普适界限。

Result: CWT平滑了能量中的熵，恢复了标准统计力学，并揭示了信息处理功项。此外，还预测了宇宙总可生成复杂性与全息熵的同阶关系。

Conclusion: CWT统一了热力学、量子计算和引力现象，为理解复杂性和信息处理提供了新框架。

Abstract: Classical thermodynamic singularities at phase transitions and in
negative-temperature regimes arise because the equal-a-priori probability
postulate overlooks the quantum dynamical complexity required to prepare
microstates. We promote bounded dynamical complexity to a postulate and develop
Complexity Windowed Thermodynamics (CWT). Introducing a finite complexity
budget yields the windowed entropy, an entropy of ignorance that is smooth in
energy and monotonically non-increasing in the budget. Smoothness guarantees a
finite, continuous effective temperature and a non-negative complexity
generation potential, thereby regularizing all classical singularities while
recovering standard statistical mechanics as the complexity budget approaches
infinity. CWT's generalized first law unveils an information processing work
term. From unitary channel geometry we derive universal bounds on action and
time: the action consumed must be proportional to the optimal circuit
complexity, while the minimum required time is inversely proportional to the
effective temperature. The framework unifies phenomena from critical point
smoothing to black hole information flow, and predicts that the universe's
total generatable complexity and its holographic entropy are of the same order
bridging thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 论文扩展了Berry的几何-动态相位分解理论，将其应用于波散射问题，提出了广义Wigner-Smith算子（GWSO），并展示了其在多种物理系统中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自Berry的开创性工作以来，几何与动态相位分解在波物理中变得至关重要。本文旨在将这一分解扩展到波散射问题中，以揭示几何与动态效应在散射过程中的相互作用。

Method: 通过引入广义Wigner-Smith算子（GWSO），对散射矩阵的梯度进行分析，将观测值的偏移分解为几何和动态部分。

Result: GWSO及其导致的期望值偏移均可分解为几何和动态部分，并通过一系列实例验证了这一理论框架的普适性。

Conclusion: 这一统一框架揭示了波散射中几何与动态的相互作用，并适用于广泛的物理系统。

Abstract: Since Berry's pioneering 1984 work, the separation of geometric and dynamic
contributions in the phase of an evolving wave has become fundamental in wave
physics, underpinning diverse phenomena in quantum mechanics, optics, and
condensed matter. Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the
wave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where
observables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in
their expectation values between the input and output wave sates. We describe
this class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated
generalized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the
scattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or
momentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting
expectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and
geometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory
through a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light
transmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry
phase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam
shifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D
scattering. This unifying framework illuminates the interplay between geometry
and dynamics in wave scattering and can be readily applied to a broad range of
physical systems.

Motivation: 现有文献已推导出冯·诺依曼熵的前两累积量，但缺乏对其分布不对称性（偏度）的完整描述。

Method: 通过简化涉及多伽马函数的大量有限求和，推导第三累积量的精确闭合公式。

Result: 成功获得第三累积量的闭合表达式，提升了对冯·诺依曼熵分布的逼近精度。

Conclusion: 研究填补了Bures-Hall系综中熵分布不对称性描述的空白，为相关领域提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: We study the degree of entanglement, as measured by von Neumann entropy, of
bipartite systems over the Bures-Hall ensemble. Closed-form expressions of the
first two cumulants of von Neumann entropy over the ensemble have been recently
derived in the literature. In this paper, we focus on its skewness by
calculating the third cumulant that describes the degree of asymmetry of the
distribution. The main result is an exact closed-form formula of the third
cumulant, which leads to a more accurate approximation to the distribution of
von Neumann entropy. The key to obtaining the result lies on finding a dozen of
new summation identities in simplifying a large number of finite summations
involving polygamma functions.

Conclusion: 提出相互作用BEC在倾斜晶格中作为量子临界传感平台，为精密梯度传感开辟新途径。

Abstract: We investigate localization transitions in interacting Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) confined in tilted optical lattices, focusing on both the
continuum limit accessed via shallow lattice depths and the tight-binding limit
realized in the deep lattice regime. Utilizing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
(GPE) and the many-body Bose-Hubbard model, we analyze the scaling behavior of
localization indicators, such as the root mean square width and fidelity
susceptibility, as a function of the applied tilt. Our results reveal clear
signatures of a localization-delocalization transition driven by the linear
potential, with scaling properties that characterize criticality even in the
presence of interactions within the GPE description. Despite the single-mode
nature of the condensate wavefunction, we demonstrate that it can effectively
probe quantum criticality. Building on this, we propose the use of interacting
BECs in tilted lattices as a platform for quantum critical sensing, where the
condensate wavefunction serves both as a sensitive probe of localization and a
practical resource for quantum-enhanced metrology. This approach opens new
avenues for precision gradient sensing based on localization phenomena in
bosonic systems.

Conclusion: 蜂窝超晶格几何为研究新型量子相提供了平台，理论预测对实验有指导意义。

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the
Bose-Hubbard model on a honeycomb superlattice. The interplay between the
superlattice potential depth $\Delta/t$ and the onsite interaction $U/t$ gives
rise to three distinct quantum phases at zero temperature: a superfluid phase,
a Mott insulator I phase with unit filling on each site, and a Mott insulator
II phase characterized by density imbalance-double occupancy on one sublattice
and vacancy on the other at unit filling. The SF-MI transitions are found to be
continuous, consistent with second-order quantum phase transitions. We further
extend our analysis to finite temperatures within the superfluid regime. Our
work highlights how a honeycomb superlattice geometry enables access to
interaction- and lattice-modulation-driven quantum phases, including a
density-imbalanced Mott insulator and a robust superfluid regime, offering
concrete theoretical predictions for cold-atom experiments.

Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice, with a sudden
position-dependent change (a quench) in the effective dispersion relation, have
been proposed by Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al as an analogue spacetime test of the
Unruh effect. We provide new support for this analogue by analysing the
entanglement of a scalar field in a (1 + 1)-dimensional continuum spacetime
with a similar quench, and the harvesting of this entanglement by a pair of
Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We present numerical evidence that the concurrence and
mutual information harvested by the detectors are qualitatively similar to
those in Rindler spacetime, but they exhibit a small yet noticeable variation
when the energy pulse created by the quench crosses the detectors. These
findings provide further motivation to implement the experimental proposal of
Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al.

Abstract: We derive Klein-Gordon equation and Schr\"odinger equation on curved

constrained spineless particles. We start from the equations on the main
manifold and obtain the effective equations on the submanifold by degenerate
additional dimensions. A geometric induced potential appears in our results.We
reviewed the previous works of others and our results are consistent in the
special case they calculated,We focused on discussing our results under general
conditions and obtained a connection between differential geometry and
physics.Especially the influence of peripheral manifolds on submanifold physics
is somewhat counterintuitive.We have analyzed several explicit examples,
presenting an elucidation of the interactions between the submanifold and
matter fields. In one specific case, our approach derived the mass term of
scalar fields on a lower-dimensional manifold through purely geometric
induction. This mass term coincides with that in Kaluza-Klein theory, yet was
achieved without invoking any periodic compactification constraints.

Abstract: We investigate the charging performance of a quantum battery (QB) coupled to
a scalar field under the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole.
It is shown that under Dirichlet boundary conditions, when the QB's energy
level spacing is smaller than the charging amplitude, the black hole rotation
enhances the charging performance at finite times, whereas in other parameter
regimes, it degrades the charging performance. Notably, as the black hole
approaches extremal rotation, charging performance undergoes significant
amplification or suppression, depending on the parameter regime. This indicates
that the performance of QBs can probe critical properties of black holes.
Additionally, regarding the energy flow in QB, it is further demonstrated that
the energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations via dissipation, and rotation
suppresses the QB's capacity to extract this energy. Our findings not only
advance the relativistic dissipation dynamics of QBs but also propose a novel
method to detect black hole rotation and extremal-state transitions.

Abstract: In recent years, various techniques have been explored for the verification
of quantum circuits, including the use of barrier certificates, mathematical
tools capable of demonstrating the correctness of such systems. These
certificates ensure that, starting from initial states and applying the
system's dynamics, the system will never reach undesired states. In this paper,
we propose a methodology for synthesizing such certificates for quantum
circuits using a scenario-based approach, for both finite and infinite time
horizons. In addition, our approach can handle uncertainty in the initial
states and in the system's dynamics. We present several case studies on quantum
circuits, comparing the performance of different types of barrier certificate
and analyzing which one is most suitable for each case.

Abstract: Holographic quantum error-correcting codes, often realized through tensor
network architectures, have emerged as compelling toy models for exploring
bulk-boundary duality in AdS-CFT. By encoding bulk information into highly
entangled boundary degrees of freedom, they capture key features of holography
such as subregion duality, operator reconstruction, and complementary recovery.
Among them, hyperinvariant tensor networks-characterized by the inclusion of
edge tensors and the enforcement of multi-tensor isometries-offer a promising
platform for realizing features such as state dependence and nontrivial
boundary correlations. However, existing constructions are largely confined to
two-dimensional regular tilings, and the structural principles underlying
hyperinvariance remain poorly understood, especially in higher dimensions. To
address this, we introduce a geometric criterion called angular k-uniformity,
which refines standard k-uniformity and its planar variants by requiring
isometric behavior within angular sectors of a tensor's rotationally symmetric
layout. This condition enables the systematic identification and construction
of hyperinvariant holographic codes on regular hyperbolic honeycombs in
arbitrary dimension, and extends naturally to heterogeneous networks and qLEGO
architectures beyond regular tilings. Altogether, angular k-uniformity provides
a versatile, geometry-aware framework for analyzing and designing holographic
tensor networks and codes with hyperinvariant features such as nontrivial
boundary correlations and state-dependent complementary recovery.

Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum
many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial
tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the
geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the
entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the
area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This
implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of
entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of
research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects
towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this
direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic
spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity
theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next,
we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those
spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections
between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question
of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and
time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.

Abstract: We establish a direct connection between spread complexity and quantum
circuit complexity by demonstrating that spread complexity emerges as a
limiting case of a circuit complexity framework built from two fundamental
operations: time-evolution and superposition. Our approach leverages a
computational setup where unitary gates and beam-splitting operations generate
target states, with the minimal cost of synthesis yielding a complexity measure
that converges to spread complexity in the infinitesimal time-evolution limit.
This perspective not only provides a physical interpretation of spread
complexity but also offers computational advantages, particularly in scenarios
where traditional methods like the Lanczos algorithm fail. We illustrate our
framework with an explicit SU(2) example and discuss broader applications,
including cases where return amplitudes are non-perturbative or divergent

Abstract: Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which
shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the
Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic
structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the
computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the
transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and
demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the
two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical
inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated
Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the
entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS
representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller
correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated
method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four
times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that
transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard
non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated
DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$,
with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the
largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.
