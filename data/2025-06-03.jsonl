Classical approaches\nhave significantly advanced sequential prediction, including autoregressive\nmodels and deep learning architectures such as temporal convolutional networks\n(TCNs) and Transformers. Yet, they remain resource-intensive and often scale\npoorly in data-limited or hardware-constrained settings. We propose a\nquantum-native time series forecasting framework that harnesses\nentanglement-based parameterized quantum circuits to learn temporal\ndependencies. Our Quantum Time Series (QTS) model encodes normalized sequential\ndata into single-qubit rotations and embeds temporal structure through\nstructured entanglement patterns. This design considers predictive performance\nwith logarithmic complexity in training data and parameter count. We benchmark\nQTS against classical models on synthetic and real-world datasets, including\ngeopotential height fields used in numerical weather prediction. Experiments on\nthe noisy backend and real IBM quantum hardware demonstrate that QTS can\ncapture temporal patterns using fewer data points. Hardware benchmarking\nresults establish quantum entanglement as a practical computational resource\nfor temporal modelling, with potential near-term applications in nano-scale\nsystems, quantum sensor networks, and other forecasting scenarios."}

We leverage the algebraic structure of the\nfermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently\ncomputable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a\nclear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation\nfunctions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase\ntransitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers\nspecial solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to\nout-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources\nbecome more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems.

This study revealed that the Bell\ninequalities on normalized density function is true only for photon\npolarization at individual instances but it does not hold over the entire\npopulation in a given system. The Bell inequalities is not an incompatibility\ncriterion for local hidden variables vs quantum mechanics rather it is a\ncriterion for an individual nature vs population dynamics. The study found that\nthe local variables (photon polarization) described each quantity in Bell test\nand a complete agreement with the experiments where quantum mechanics was\nincapable to provide as it is a unified system. The paper concludes with great\nsatisfaction that the simultaneous measurement of two correlated photons at a\ndistance was a local cause (photon-filter interaction did not violate the\nspecial theory of relativity) and the nonlocality description given by the\nwavefunction was not physical."}
