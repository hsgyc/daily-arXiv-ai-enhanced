We demonstrate that the\ngeodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion of the curve govern\nthe emergent non-Abelian gauge potential and effective scalar potential in the\nsystem's Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the\ngauge potential are analyzed, revealing that the rotation angle of spin\norientation along a surface boundary and the pseudo-magnetic flux are\ntopologically governed by the surface geometry. Spin texture evolution along\nhelices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic\npropagation. Further, spin evolution in a closed trajectory-Viviani's curve,\nexemplifies the surface-dependent spin orientation and path-ordering\nsensitivity of the non-Abelian gauge potential.

We perform numerical\nsimulations using Qiskit, systematically varying the noise strength\n($\\sigma_{\\text{OU}}$) and correlation time ($\\tau_c$) of the OU process.

We investigate strategies for distributing quantum entanglement\nbetween two distant parties through noisy quantum channels. Specifically, we\ncompare two configurations: one where the entanglement source is placed at the\nmidpoint of the communication line, and another where it is located at one end.\nFor certain families of qubit channels we show analytically that the midpoint\nstrategy is optimal. Based on extensive numerical analysis, we conjecture that\nthis strategy is generally optimal for all qubit channels. Focusing on the\nmidpoint configuration, we develop semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques to\nassess whether entanglement can be successfully distributed through the\nnetwork, and to quantify the amount of entanglement that can be distributed in\nthe process. In many relevant cases the SDP formulation reliably captures the\nmaximal amount of entanglement which can be distributed, if entanglement is\nquantified using the negativity. We analyze several channel models and\ndemonstrate that, for various combinations of amplitude damping and\ndepolarizing noise, entanglement distribution is only possible with weakly\nentangled input states.

An additional aspect of this framework is the\ninfluence of partial knowledge about the input on the optimal measurement\nstrategies. This kind of side information can significantly influence the\nguessing strategy and earlier work has shown that the timing of such side\ninformation, whether revealed before or after the measurement, can affect the\nsuccess probabilities. In this work, we go beyond this established distinction\nby introducing the concept of metainformation. Metainformation is information\nabout information, and in our context it is knowledge that additional side\ninformation of certain type will become later available, even if it is not yet\nprovided. We show that this seemingly subtle difference between having no\nexpectation of further information versus knowing it will arrive can have\noperational consequences for the guessing task.

A promising idea is to represent flows\non a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of\nthe number of parameters with the mesh size.

Traditional steady-state\napproaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient\ndynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time\nscales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism,\nwithin the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz\n($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit\napproximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and\nenergy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions\nto the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results\nhighlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the\nefficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric\ntransport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym\ntheory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved\nthermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene\nmolecular junction."}

This\nposition paper argues that LLM agents can potentially help accelerate\ntheoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with\ndomain knowledge and toolbox. We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics\n-- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps\nin physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We\nenvision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,\npropose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision\nrequires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and\ndeveloping robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts\nbetween physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in\nphysics."}

We compute numerically the spectral decomposition of the\nstatistical ensemble of states, the thermodynamic and entanglement entropies,\nthe population imbalance, the quantum Fisher information, and the coherence\nvisibility. We analyze their dependence on the system parameters, showing in\nparticular how finite temperature and on-site energy asymmetry affect the\nentanglement and coherence properties of the system. Moreover, starting from a\nquantum phase model which accurately describes the system over a wide range of\ninteractions, we develop a reliable description of the strong tunneling regime,\nwhere thermal averages may be computed analytically using a modified Boltzmann\nweight involving an effective temperature. We discuss the possibility of\napplying this effective description to other models in suitable regimes."}
