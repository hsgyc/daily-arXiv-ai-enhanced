Comments welcome!", "summary": "Recent work by Renou et al. (2021) has led to some controversy concerning the\nquestion of whether quantum theory requires complex numbers for its\nformulation. We promote the view that the main result of that work is best\nunderstood not as a claim about the relative merits of different\nrepresentations of quantum theory, but rather as a claim about the possibility\nof experimentally adjudicating between standard quantum theory and an\nalternative theory -- a foil theory -- known as real-amplitude quantum theory\n(RQT). In particular, the claim is that this adjudication can be achieved given\nonly an assumption about the causal structure of the experiment. Here, we aim\nto shed some light on why this is possible, by reconceptualizing the comparison\nof the two theories as an instance of a broader class of such theory\ncomparisons. By recasting RQT as the subtheory of quantum theory that arises by\nsymmetrizing with respect to the collective action of a time-reversal symmetry,\nwe can compare it to other subtheories that arise by symmetrization, but for\ndifferent symmetries. If the symmetry has a unitary representation, the\nresulting foil theory is termed a twirled quantum world, and if it does not (as\nis the case in RQT), the resulting foil theory is termed a swirled quantum\nworld. We show that, in contrast to RQT, there is no possibility of\ndistinguishing any twirled quantum world from quantum theory given only an\nassumption about causal structure. We also define analogues of twirling and\nswirling for an arbitrary generalized probabilistic theory and identify certain\nnecessary conditions on a causal structure for it to be able to support a\ncausal compatibility gap between the theory and its symmetrized version. We\ndraw out the implications of these analyses for the question of how a lack of a\nshared reference frame state features into the possibility of such a gap."}

Stabilizer codes, and in particular topological\nsurface codes, are promising candidates for implementing QEC by redundantly\nencoding quantum information. While it is widely believed that a strictly\nfault-tolerant protocol can only be implemented using single- and two-qubit\ngates, several quantum computing platforms, based on trapped ions, neutral\natoms and also superconducting qubits support native multi-qubit operations,\ne.g. using multi-ion entangling gates, Rydberg blockade or parallelized tunable\ncouplers, respectively. In this work, we show that stabilizer measurement\ncircuits for unrotated surface codes can be fault-tolerant using single\nauxiliary qubits and three-qubit gates. These gates enable lower-depth circuits\nleading to fewer fault locations and potentially shorter QEC cycle times.\nConcretely, we find that in an optimistic parameter regime where fidelities of\nthree-qubit gates are the same as those of two-qubit gates, the logical error\nrate can be up to one order of magnitude lower and the threshold can be\nsignificantly higher, increasing from $\\approx 0.76 \\%$ to $\\approx 1.05 \\%$.\nOur results, which are applicable to a wide range of platforms, thereby\nmotivate further investigation into multi-qubit gates as components for\nfault-tolerant QEC, as they can lead to substantial advantages in terms of time\nand physical qubit resources required to reach a target logical error rate."}

Abstract shortened to meet arxiv requirements", "summary": "Finding the ground state of strongly-interacting fermionic systems is often\nthe prerequisite for fully understanding both quantum chemistry and condensed\nmatter systems. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a representative example\nof such a system; it is particularly interesting not only due to the existence\nof efficient quantum algorithms preparing approximations to the ground state\nsuch as Hastings--O'Donnell (STOC 2022), but also known no-go results for many\nclassical ansatzes in preparing low-energy states. However, this\nquantum-classical separation is known to \\emph{not} persist when the SYK model\nis sufficiently sparsified, i.e., when terms in the model are discarded with\nprobability $1-p$, where $p=\\Theta(1/n^3)$ and $n$ is the system size. This\nraises the question of how robust the quantum and classical complexities of the\nSYK model are to sparsification.\n  In this work we initiate the study of the sparse SYK model where $p \\in\n[\\Theta(1/n^3),1]$. We show there indeed exists a certain robustness of\nsparsification. First, we prove that the quantum algorithm of\nHastings--O'Donnell for $p=1$ still achieves a constant-factor approximation to\nthe ground energy when $p\\geq\\Omega(\\log n/n)$. Additionally, we prove that\nwith high probability, Gaussian states cannot achieve better than a\n$O(\\sqrt{\\log n/pn})$-factor approximation to the true ground state energy of\nsparse SYK. This is done through a general classical circuit complexity\nlower-bound of $\\Omega(pn^3)$ for any quantum state achieving a constant-factor\napproximation. Combined, these show a provable separation between classical\nalgorithms outputting Gaussian states and efficient quantum algorithms for the\ngoal of finding approximate sparse SYK ground states when $p \\geq \\Omega(\\log\nn/n)$, extending the analogous $p=1$ result of Hastings--O'Donnell."}

As such, one might consider\nsuch phase space approaches ad hoc. To that end, here we show how to formally\nextract exact quantum energies from a coupled nuclear-electronic Hamiltonian\nusing perturbation theory on top of a phase space electronic framework.
