### [1] [Derivation of Fokker-Planck equation from Schrodinger dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22693)
*Irfan Lone*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 通过量子力学方法推导Fokker-Planck方程，并讨论其路径积分表示，指出热力学熵对应于量子熵的粗粒化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基于量子力学方法的一致性推导Fokker-Planck方程，并理解其路径积分表示的意义。

Method: 采用可逆的薛定谔动力学作为量子力学基础，利用时间无关哈密顿量的本征态表示进行推导。

Result: 成功推导出Fokker-Planck方程，并发现热力学熵对应于量子熵的粗粒化。

Conclusion: 通过量子力学方法推导的Fokker-Planck方程揭示了热力学熵与量子熵的关系，为理解其物理意义提供了新视角。

Abstract: The Fokker_Planck equation can be derived in a consistent manner through a
microscopic approach based on a unified scheme of classical and quantum
mechanics. Here we shall derive it through a purely quantum mechanical approach
based on the reversible Schrodinger dynamics. We also give a brief discussion
of the path integral representation of the Fokker_Planck equation in light of
our derivation. We conclude that, because of the use of the representation of
eigenstates of the time-independent Hamiltonian in our derivation, the
thermodynamical entropy in this case must correspond to a coarse-graining of
the quantum entropy.

### [2] [Routing-Aware Placement for Zoned Neutral Atom-based Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22715)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编译器将布局和路由阶段独立处理，导致重排效率低下，论文旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 相比现有技术，平均减少17%的重排时间，最佳情况下减少49%。

Conclusion: 路由感知布局方法显著提升了量子计算的效率，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to solve previously intractable problems, with
neutral atoms emerging as a promising technology. Zoned neutral atom
architectures allow for immense parallelism and higher coherence times by
shielding idling atoms from interference with laser beams. However, in addition
to hardware, successful quantum computation requires sophisticated software
support, particularly compilers that optimize quantum algorithms for hardware
execution. In the compilation flow for zoned neutral atom architectures, the
effective interplay of the placement and routing stages decides the overhead
caused by rearranging the atoms during the quantum computation. Sub-optimal
placements can lead to unnecessary serialization of the rearrangements in the
subsequent routing stage. Despite this, all existing compilers treat placement
and routing independently thus far - focusing solely on minimizing travel
distances. This work introduces the first routing-aware placement method to
address this shortcoming. It groups compatible movements into parallel
rearrangement steps to minimize both rearrangement steps and travel distances.
The implementation utilizing the A* algorithm reduces the rearrangement time by
17% on average and by 49% in the best case compared to the state-of-the-art.
The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich
Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qmap.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了量子态制备中多重错误机制的临界行为，为理解非幺正重整化群流动提供了新视角。

Abstract: In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors
are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement
beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a
continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional
non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of
certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality,
respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors
simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime
of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes
unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this
critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the
entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of
random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or
GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits.
Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor
network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million
qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime
leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient
non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the
percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For
percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of
exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical
results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.

Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in
non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic,
vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales.
Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons,
and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we
demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in
a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model (LVCM). Employing tailored
spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate
a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor
electronic sites and follow its excitation transfer in real time. We
continuously drive the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the
vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by tuning the vibronic
coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at
large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that
reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient
transfer. These results show that the presence of just one additional vibration
reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work also
establishes a scalable route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode
vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of
next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.

### [5] [Exact analysis of AC sensors based on Floquet time crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22731)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了Floquet时间晶体（FTC）在封闭系统中作为AC传感器的行为，分析了其量子Fisher信息（QFI）动力学，展示了如何通过调节AC场实现Heisenberg级精度，并探讨了不同初始态和相变下的传感器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索FTC在传感器中的应用潜力，尤其是其QFI动力学如何实现高精度测量。

Method: 通过理论分析QFI动力学，调节AC场方向和频率，研究不同初始态和相变下的传感器性能。

Result: 展示了FTC传感器在Heisenberg级精度下的长时间稳定性，并揭示了QFI的阶梯状时间结构。

Conclusion: FTC作为AC传感器具有高精度和稳定性，QFI动力学揭示了其临界行为，为传感器设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We discuss the behavior of general Floquet Time Crystals (FTCs), including
prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an
analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which
characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and
frequency of the AC field, we show how to resonantly induce transitions between
macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor, allowing a robust Heisenberg
scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the
system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like
structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The
behavior is discussed for different relevant initial preparations of the
sensor, including ground states, low and high correlated states. Furthermore,
we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition, with
the QFI capturing its critical exponents. We present our findings for both
linear and nonlinear response regimes, and illustrate them for a specific FTC
based on the long-range interacting LMG model.

### [6] [Interpretable Scaling Behavior in Sparse Subnetwork Representations of Quantum States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22734)
*Brandon Barton,Juan Carrasquilla,Christopher Roth,Agnes Valenti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 彩票假设（LTH）在量子多体哈密顿量的基态近似任务中扩展，稀疏子网络性能与密集网络相当，且性能仅依赖于子网络结构而非初始化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索彩票假设在量子多体系统中的应用，验证稀疏网络能否高效近似基态。

Method: 针对横向场伊辛模型（TFIM）和环面码（TC），训练稀疏网络并与密集网络比较性能。

Result: 稀疏网络在参数大幅减少后仍能保持高精度，且性能与初始化无关；发现普适的标度行为和稀疏诱导的量子相变。

Conclusion: 稀疏网络不仅高效，还能增强对哈密顿量物理的理解，为量子计算提供新工具。

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits that within overparametrized
neural networks, there exist sparse subnetworks that are capable of matching
the performance of the original model when trained in isolation from the
original initialization. We extend this hypothesis to the unsupervised task of
approximating the ground state of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, a problem
equivalent to finding a neural-network compression of the lowest-lying
eigenvector of an exponentially large matrix. Focusing on two representative
quantum Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the toric
code (TC), we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can reach accuracies
comparable to their dense counterparts, even when pruned by more than an order
of magnitude in parameter count. Crucially, and unlike the original LTH, we
find that performance depends only on the structure of the sparse subnetwork,
not on the specific initialization, when trained in isolation. Moreover, we
identify universal scaling behavior that persists across network sizes and
physical models, where the boundaries of scaling regions are determined by the
underlying Hamiltonian. At the onset of high-error scaling, we observe
signatures of a sparsity-induced quantum phase transition that is first-order
in shallow networks. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning enhances
interpretability by linking the structure of sparse subnetworks to the
underlying physics of the Hamiltonian.

### [7] [Sample importance for data-driven decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22741)
*Evan Peters*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论，解释了数据驱动解码（DDD）中训练数据的特殊性，并通过实验验证了一种数据增强技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据驱动解码（DDD）中训练数据的非典型特性，并提出理论框架以解释这些特性。

Method: 引入“样本重要性”理论，分析DDD中的类别不平衡和标签噪声问题，并应用数据增强技术（调整训练数据中的错误率）进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，该数据增强技术能显著提高解码器准确性，同时揭示了其失败的原因。此外，该技术对多轮综合征测量的量子码解码也有效。

Conclusion: 样本重要性和数据增强技术在改进实验相关数据驱动解码器方面具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Data-driven decoding (DDD) -- learning to decode syndromes of (quantum)
error-correcting codes using training examples -- can be a difficult problem
due to several atypical and poorly understood properties of the training data.
We introduce a theory of example importance that clarifies these unusual
aspects of DDD: For instance, we show that DDD of a simple error-correcting
code is equivalent to a noisy, imbalanced binary classification problem. This
suggests that an existing data augmentation technique -- turning the knob to
increase error rates in training data -- actually introduces a tradeoff between
class imbalance and label noise. We apply this technique in experiments showing
robust improvements to decoder accuracy while explaining the failures of this
technique in terms of example importance. We show similar improvements for
decoding quantum codes involving multiple rounds of syndrome measurements and
we characterize example importance in random stabilizer codes, suggesting broad
applicability of both example importance and turning the knob for improving
experimentally relevant data-driven decoders.

### [8] [Information-Computation Gaps in Quantum Learning via Low-Degree Likelihood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22743)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量子数据学习中，设计高效提取信息的协议仍具挑战性，且在某些情况下被认为是不可能的。经典文献中有大量工具用于证明统计推断问题的平均情况硬度，而量子领域的类似工具较少。

Method: 扩展经典的低阶方法到量子设置，建立状态设计与低阶硬度的联系，并应用于随机稀疏非局域哈密顿量的Gibbs态学习、随机浅量子电路态学习等问题。

Conclusion: 研究为量子学习问题提供了新的硬度证明工具，填补了量子与经典方法之间的空白，并揭示了局部测量与纠缠测量在问题复杂度上的差异。

Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data,
designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information
remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to
be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While
there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence
for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding
tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the
classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness
of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree
polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree
hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for
learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it
to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a
challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To
our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework
was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree
hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with
single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and
identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for
protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity
landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more
entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning
Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.

Conclusion: 通过几何方法揭示了手性分子光响应的对映体敏感性机制。

Abstract: We develop a mathematical formalism underlying the emergence of
enantio-sensitive molecular orientation due to photoionization or
photoexitation of chiral molecules. We consider geometric quantities such as
the Berry connection and Berry curvature in light-driven chiral electronic
states in the space of complex light polarization vectors. The parametric
dependence of the light-driven electronic wavefunction on such vectors emerges
due to various possible mutual orientations between the laser field and a
chiral molecule. Using the tools of differential geometry we show how the
enantio-sensitive observables emerge from the geometry of the molecular
response in such spaces.

*Francesco Libbi,Lorenzo Monacelli,Boris Kozinsky*

Main category: quant-ph

Result: 成功诱导SrTiO$_3$发生铁电相变，预测了非平衡态的稳定条件。

Conclusion: 首次展示了通过脉冲光调控量子涨落，改变量子系统行为的方法。

Abstract: Similar to other perovskites in its family, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits a significant
softening of the ferroelectric mode with decreasing temperature, a behavior
that typically heralds the onset of a ferroelectric transition. However, this
material remains paraelectric down to 0K due to the Heisenberg quantum
uncertainty principle that prevents atoms from localizing in the ferroelectric
minima, a fundamental limit that appears impossible to overcome. This work
shows that in the strong out-of-equilibrium regime induced by resonant mid-IR
pulses, quantum fluctuations can be suppressed, effectively cooling the
material below the 0K ground state and inducing a ferroelectric transition in
SrTiO$_3$ that is otherwise impossible. The appearance of a metastable state,
that is distinct from the conventional ground state, is the first demonstration
of how it is possible to leverage and control quantum fluctuations with pulsed
light to qualitatively alter the free energy landscape of a quantum system. We
predict the conditions and system parameter under which induced non-equilibrium
state can be long-lived and even permanent. In providing a quantitative
description, based on first principles machine learned potential energy
surface, we explain recent experimental observations of light-induced
ferroelectric transition in this material.

Conclusion: NJL模型为研究相互作用量子场论中的QET提供了平台，并为量子硬件上的实验实现铺平了道路。

Abstract: We propose a novel timelike quantum energy teleportation (QET) protocol
within the 1+1 dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, an interacting
fermionic field theory exhibiting spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. By
coupling localized Unruh-DeWitt detectors to the fermionic field, we
demonstrate how an initial observer's measurement enables a second observer to
extract energy at a later time using only classical information transfer. This
protocol leverages the NJL vacuum's rich entanglement structure, driven by the
chiral condensate, to facilitate energy transfer without physical particle
transport. We derive the energy flows and explore the roles of measurement and
time evolution and validate the protocol through quantum circuit simulations on
a lattice-regularized NJL model. Our findings highlight the NJL model's
potential as a platform for exploring QET in interacting quantum field theories
and pave the way for experimental realizations on quantum hardware.

Conclusion: 该方法为在当前量子设备上实现量子热态制备提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta}\propto e^{-\beta H}$
corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across
quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study
it with quantum computers. Although solved {in principle} by recent
constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that
provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F. Chen {\it et al},
arXiv:2311.09207] -- their implementation requires large-scale quantum
computational resources and is hence challenging {in practice} on current or
even near-term quantum devices. Here, we propose a scheme for approximately
preparing quantum thermal states that only requires the [repeated]
implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of
$H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c)
reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous performance guarantees independent of
detailed physical knowledge of $H$ beyond its locality.

Conclusion: 该研究为利用强激光脉冲生成和控制电子激发态及相干性提供了新框架，适用于强场化学控制和激光领域。

Abstract: Tunneling ionization followed by strong-field excitation leads to important
ultrafast phenomena such as charge migration and lasing. Recent theoretical
developments suggest that the population of the ionic excited state can be
greatly enhanced due to the complex interplay between tunneling and excitation.
In this Letter, using an adiabatic approach for both tunneling and excitation,
semi-analytical solutions are derived for the population and coherence of a
two-level ionic system. This approach removes the strong-field dressing,
revealing novel sub-half-cycle processes for excited state population and
coherence buildup. It predicts that the excited state population is enhanced by
an order of magnitude, independent of the laser wavelength, while coherence
amplitude can be boosted by over four orders of magnitude for a multi-cycle
pulse. For a single-cycle pulse, it suggests that coherence amplitude decreases
rapidly as the wavelength increases. This work introduces a novel framework for
generating and controlling the electronic excited state and coherence using
intense laser pulses, with applications in strong-field control of chemistry
and lasing.

Conclusion: 结果支持普适量子理论能够一致描述微观和宏观观察者及热力学系统。

Abstract: Can quantum theory be applied on all scales? While there are many arguments
for the universality of quantum theory, this question remains a subject of
debate. It is unknown how far the existence of macroscopic irreversibility can
be derived from or reconciled with time-reversal symmetric quantum dynamics.
Furthermore, reasoning about quantum measurements can appear to produce
surprising and even paradoxical outcomes. The classical outcomes of quantum
measurements are in some contexts deemed to violate the fundamental principle
of locality, in particular when considering entanglement and Bell non-locality.
Therefore measurement, irreversibility and locality can all appear to challenge
the universality of quantum theory. In this thesis we approach these problems
using counterfactuals -- statements about the possibility and impossibility of
transformations. Using the principles of constructor theory and quantum
information theory, we find novel features of quantum thermodynamics relating
to irreversibility, information erasure and coherence. We also develop tools to
quantify the full implications of non-commutativity of quantum operators in
settings where quantum theory is applied universally to measurement devices.
This reveals new ways of characterising the quantum information stored in
entanglement and quantum branching structure. Our results reinforce the ability
of universal quantum theory to consistently describe both microscopic and
macroscopic observers and thermodynamic systems.

Abstract: The prediction of material degradation is an important problem to solve in
many industries. Environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature,
are important drivers of degradation processes, with corrosion being one of the
most prominent ones. Quantum machine learning is a promising research field but
suffers from well known deficits such as barren plateaus and measurement
overheads. To address this problem, recent research has examined quantum
reservoir computing to address time-series prediction tasks. Although a
promising idea, developing circuits that are expressive enough while respecting
the limited depths available on current devices is challenging. In classical
reservoir computing, the onion echo state network model (ESN)
[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-72359-9_9] was introduced to increase the
interpretability of the representation structure of the embeddings. This onion
ESN model utilizes a concatenation of smaller reservoirs that describe
different time scales by covering different regions of the eigenvalue spectrum.
Here, we use the same idea in the realm of quantum reservoir computing by
simultaneously evolving smaller quantum reservoirs to better capture all the
relevant time-scales while keeping the circuit depth small. We do this by
modifying the rotation angles which we show alters the eigenvalues of the
quantum evolution, but also note that modifying the number of mid-circuit
measurements accomplishes the same goals of changing the long-term or
short-term memory. This onion QRC outperforms a simple model and a single
classical reservoir for predicting the degradation of aluminum alloys in
different environmental conditions. By combining the onion QRC with an
additional classical reservoir layer, the prediction accuracy is further
improved.

Result: 光子统计符合负二项分布，表明光源为热光源。

Conclusion: SPDC的光子统计特性在量子计量、通信和计算中有广泛应用。

Abstract: The photon statistics of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC)
exhibit dependencies on wavelength, pump power, and coincidence time. Notably,
the average photon numbers were found to asymmetrically increase with
increasing pump power around the degenerate wavelength of emission. By the
coupling of the detection scheme to a spectrometer, studying different
bandwidths within the emission revealed that shorter wavelengths increased
nonlinearly with pump power, while longer wavelengths showed more linear
behavior, indicating a wavelength dependent efficiency in the generation of the
SPDC. We employ the use of a four detector Hanbury Brown and Twiss
Interferometer to study the photon statistics of the signal beam, where the
idler serves as the herald. The measured statistics were found to be best
described by a Negative Binomial Distribution, which is a characteristic of
thermal light sources. The detection and characterization of complex light
sources has wide ranging applications in the fields of quantum metrology,
quantum communications, and quantum computing, more specifically, a system that
is sensitive to wavelength and photon number distribution.

Conclusion: 量子相干性是提升热机效率的关键资源，噪声类型对性能有不同影响，电路热力学成本与信息处理直接相关。

Abstract: We evaluate the role of quantum coherence as a thermodynamic resource in a
noisy, Markovian one-qubit heat engine. We demonstrate that, when operating
according to a quantum Otto cycle, can surpass the classical efficiency limit
by consuming the coherence of noisy quantum states. Computed Leggett-Garg
temporal correlations imply the engine's non-classical nature. Amplitude
damping significantly reduces efficiency and extractable work. In contrast,
phase damping has no significant impact on the extractable work. We implement
the entire Otto cycle in a quantum circuit, simulating realistic amplitude and
phase damping channels, as well as gate-level noise. We introduce an
operational measure of the circuit's thermodynamic cost, establishing a direct
link between energy consumption and information processing in quantum heat
engines.

Motivation: 解决QUBO问题时减少测量开销并提高收敛速度。

Method: 使用ITEMC电路优化参数，仅需单比特和双比特期望值，避免全能量评估；通过迭代更新初始状态和预排序量子门顺序优化收敛。

Result: 经典模拟在150比特内达到0.99以上的近似比；硬件实验在IBM设备上验证了40至80比特的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该算法在减少测量开销和快速收敛方面表现优异，且难以用经典张量网络模拟。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving QUBO problems
using an Imaginary Time Evolution-Mimicking Circuit (ITEMC). The circuit
parameters are optimized to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, using only
single- and two-qubit expectation values. This significantly reduces the
measurement overhead by avoiding full energy evaluation. By updating the
initial state based on results from last step iteratively, the algorithm
quickly converges to the low-energy solutions. With a pre-sorting step that
optimizes quantum gate ordering based on QUBO coefficients, the convergence is
further improved. Our classical simulations achieve approximation ratios above
0.99 up to 150 qubits. Furthermore, the linear scaling of entanglement entropy
with system size suggests that the circuit is challenging to simulate
classically using tensor networks. We also demonstrate hardware runs on IBM's
device for 40, 60, and 80 qubits, and obtain solutions compatible with that
from simulated annealing.

Abstract: This book chapter gives a selective review of physical implementations and
applications of superoscillations and associated phenomena. We introduce the
field by reviewing simple examples of superoscillations and showing how their
existence naturally follows from the real part of the quantum mechanical weak
value, which the parallel phenomena of supergrowth naturally follows from the
imaginary part. Focusing on electromagnetic applications, we review the topics
of superoscillation and supergrowth in speckle, creating superoscillating hot
spots with patterned filters, superspectroscopic discrimination of two
molecules, noise mitigation and the engineering of super behavior in point
spread functions for the purpose of optical superresolution. We also cover a
variety of different methods for creating superoscillatory and supergrowing
functions, reviewing both mathematical and physical ways to create this class
of functions, and beyond. Promising directions for future research, including
superoscillations in other wave phenomena, super radar, and generalized
super-phenomena in quantum physics, are outlined.

Motivation: 经典计算技术在研究强关联系统的基态性质时存在局限性，尤其是涉及量子相变的系统。NISQ量子计算机虽噪声较高，但仍可能模拟强关联系统并提取相信息。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在VQE方法的限制下，离子阱量子处理器能够可靠地模拟强关联系统。

Abstract: Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties
of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing
techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While
the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still
high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting
information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated
transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered
magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM
with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The
competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and
next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in
the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the
ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic
boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits
are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of
VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE
succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits
are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without
using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect
recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state
energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we
show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable
simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE
approach.

Abstract: The Page curve is a curve of average subsystem entropy as a function of

and why the curve rises and falls in that manner. We also discuss the

Abstract: In this work we use optimal control to generate Discrete Time Crystals (DTC)
in generic many-body quantum systems. We define appropriate cost functions,
which, when optimized, result in the formation of DTCs. This hitherto
unexplored method represents DTCs as an optimization problem, and allows us to
find non-trivial realistic periodic control pulses and parameter regimes which
result in spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry in quantum
systems. We exemplify our approach using many-body quantum systems in the
presence, as well as absence of dissipation. We also discuss possible
experimental realization of the control protocol for generating DTCs.

Abstract: We present a density matrix-based time dependent projection operator
formalism to calculate the beyond mean-field dynamics of systems with
non-Markovian local baths and one-to-all interactions. Such models encapsulate
the physics of condensed phase systems immersed in optical cavities. We use
this method, combined with tensor network influence functionals, to study the
dynamics of the Dicke model coupled to non-Markovian local dephasing baths at
zero temperature, which has a superradiant phase transition in the mean-field
limit. The method corrects a spurious initial state dependence found in the
mean-field dynamics and describes the emergence of new time scales which are
absent in the mean-field dynamics. Our formalism, based on density matrices, is
applicable to other quantum optical systems with one-to-all interactions at
finite temperatures.

Result: 结果表明，熵的产生由相互作用引起的能量展宽和时间粗粒化驱动，数值模拟与理论预测一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果统一了观测熵和冯·诺依曼熵的概念，为量子技术中的熵控制提供了理论工具。

Abstract: This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in
isolated quantum systems governed by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
(ETH). By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that
steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions,
independent of specific coupling details. Analytical arguments reveal that
entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced
energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy
gaps. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm
logarithmic entropy scaling, consistent with predictions derived from
ETH-governed eigenstate mixing. The derived self-consistent equations for
energy shift and broadening parameters agree closely with numerical results.
These results unify observational entropy concepts with von Neumann entropy
dynamics, providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum
many-body systems. Our findings resolve longstanding debates about
interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in
quantum technologies.

Conclusion: GB-QkNN算法通过粒球和量子化优化，有效提升了kNN算法的效率。

Abstract: High time complexity is one of the biggest challenges faced by $k$-Nearest
Neighbors ($k$NN). Although current classical and quantum $k$NN algorithms have
made some improvements, they still have a speed bottleneck when facing large
amounts of data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm
called Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN). This approach achieves
higher efficiency by first employing granular-balls, which reduces the data
size needed to processed. The search process is then accelerated by adopting a
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the
time-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via
quantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search
process. By combining the use of granular-balls and quantization of the HNSW
method, our approach manages to take advantage of these treatments and
significantly reduces the time complexity of the $k$NN-like algorithms, as
revealed by a comprehensive complexity analysis.

Conclusion: 模型为中间温度下的耗散Rydberg气体提供了有效描述，揭示了量子开放系统中极限环的命运。

Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of a dissipative Ising chain with varying
quantum correlation. Invoking an ensemble-average formalism, and assuming
spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a
Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the
classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear
equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics.
In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady
state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial
translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic
steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In
particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually
disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two
extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and
zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide an effective description of
dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures, and shed light on the fate
of limit cycles in a quantum open system.

Abstract: While elementary particles obey either bosonic or fermionic exchange
statistics, generalized exchange statistics that interpolate between bosons and
fermions -- applicable to quasi-particles -- constitute an intriguing topic,
both from the fundamental and practical points of view. This work develops a
scattering framework for two identical 1D bosonic anyons and two identical 1D
fermionic anyons with zero-range contact interactions. The two-body system with
zero-range interactions, both in free space and under external confinement, is
used to illustrate the recently proposed bosonic-anyon -- fermionic-anyon
mapping~(R. Hidalgo-Sacoto {\em{et al.}}, arXiv:2505.17669), which connects the
eigenstates of bosonic anyons to those of fermionic anyons and vice versa.
Performing explicit calculations for two-particle systems, the momentum
distributions and the off-diagonal correlations of the single-particle density
matrix for bosonic anyons and fermionic anyons are confirmed to be distinct. We
also confirm the previously derived asymptotic coefficients of the momentum
distribution tail at orders $k^{-2}$ and $k^{-3}$ for two harmonically confined
anyons. Non-universal contributions at order $k^{-4}$ are discussed.

Conclusion: ORCA TBI在物理设备上可能优于模拟器表现，未来需进一步验证其在噪声和扩展性限制下的实际性能。

Abstract: Boson Sampling, a non-universal computing paradigm, has resulted in
impressive claims of quantum supremacy. ORCA Computing have developed a
time-bin interferometer (TBI) that claims to use the principles of boson
sampling to solve a number of computational problems including optimisation and
generative adversarial networks. We solve a dominating set problem with a
surveillance use case on the ORCA TBI simulator to benchmark the use of these
devices against classical algorithms. Simulation has been used to consider the
optimal performance of the computing paradigm without having to factor in
noise, errors and scaling limitations. We show that the ORCA TBI is capable of
solving moderately sized (n<250) dominating set problems with comparable
success to linear programming and greedy methods. Wall clock timing shows that
the simulator has worse scaling than the classical methods, but this is
unlikely to carry over to the physical device where the outputs are measured
rather than calculated.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that integrates Majorana's
infinite-component relativistic equation within the algebraic structure of
paraparticles through the minimal nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times
\mathbb{Z}_2$--graded Lie algebras and $R$-matrix quantization. By mapping
spin-dependent mass spectra to graded sectors associated with generalized
quantum statistics, we derive an equation embodying Majorana's mass-spin
relation describing Majorana quasiparticles of structured light carrying spin
and orbital angular momentum. These quanta in the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times
\mathbb{Z}_2$--graded algebras and $R$-matrix formulations extend the previous
results from superconducting qubits to photonic platforms and set up
deterministic 2-photon gates involving at least two qubits encoded in a single
photon without nonlinear effects. This makes feasible general quantum computing
pathways exploiting fractional statistics through Nelson's quantum mechanics
and implement a novel procedure for error correction in photonic platforms.
Furthermore, this approach makes possible to set paraparticle-based quantum
information processing, beyond fermions and bosons, using graded qudits.

Abstract: With the rapid development of quantum computers in recent years, the
importance of performance evaluation in quantum algorithms has been increasing.
One method that has gained attention for performing this evaluation on
classical computers is tensor networks. Tensor networks not only reduce the
computational cost required for simulations by using approximations but are
also deeply connected to entanglement. Entanglement is one of the most
important elements for the quantum advantages of quantum algorithms, but the
direct relationship between quantum advantages and entanglement remains largely
unexplored. Tensor networks are promising as a means to address this question.
In this study, we focus on the entanglement in the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This study aims to investigate entanglement in
QAOA by examining the relationship between the approximation rates of tensor
networks and the performance of QAOA. Specifically, we actually perform tensor
network simulations of QAOA on a classical computer and extend the study of the
scaling relations presented in previous research. We have discovered that
scaling relations hold even when entanglement entropy is used as the vertical
axis. Furthermore, by analyzing the results of the numerical calculations, we
propose a new function for the scaling relation. Additionally, we discovered
interesting relationships regarding the behavior of entanglement in QAOA during
our analysis. This research is expected to provide new insights into the
theoretical foundation of the scaling relations presented in previous studies.

Abstract: Topologically Associating Chromatic Domains are spatially distinct chromatin
regions that regulate transcription by segregating active and inactive genomic
elements. Empirical studies show that their formation correlates with local
patterns of epigenetic markers, yet the precise mechanisms linking 1D
epigenetic landscapes to 3D chromatin folding remain unclear. Recent models
represent chromatin as a spin system, where nucleosomes are treated as
discrete-state variables coupled by interaction strengths derived from genomic
and epigenomic data. Classical samplers struggle with these models due to high
frustration and dense couplings. Here, we present a quantum annealing (QA)
approach to efficiently sample chromatin states, embedding an epigenetic Ising
model into the topology of D-Wave quantum processors.

Abstract: In order to determine what quantum operations and measurements are consistent
with the laws of thermodynamics, one must start by allowing all processes
allowed by the framework of quantum theory, and then impose the laws of
thermodynamics as a set of constraints. Here, we consider a hierarchy of
quantum operations and measurements that are consistent with ($I$) the weak
third law, ($II$) the strong third law, and ($III$) both the second and the
third laws of thermodynamics, i.e., operations and measurements that are fully
consistent with thermodynamics. Such characterisation allows us to identify
which particular thermodynamic principle is responsible for the
(un)attainability of a given quantum operation or measurement. In the case of
channels, i.e., trace-preserving operations, we show that a channel belongs to
($I$) and ($II$) if and only if it is strictly positive and rank
non-decreasing, respectively, whereas a channel belongs to ($III$) only if it
is rank non-decreasing and does not perturb a strictly positive state. On the
other hand, while thermodynamics does not preclude the measurability of any
POVM, the realisable state-update rules for measurements are increasingly
restricted as we go from ($I$) to ($III$).

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms hold great promise for solving quantum
control problems on near-term quantum computers. In this work, we employ the
hybrid framework that integrates digital quantum simulation with classical
optimization to achieve optimal engineering of quantum many-body systems. To
evaluate the overall performance of this method, we introduce a general metric
termed control optimality, which accounts for constraints on both classical and
quantum components. As a concrete example, we investigate the time-optimal
control for perfect state transfer in a one-dimensional spin model using the
variational quantum algorithm, closely approaching the quantum speed limit.
Moreover, we discuss the emergent gradient behavior and error robustness,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying hybrid quantum algorithms to solve
quantum optimal control problems. These results establish a systematic
framework for hybrid algorithms to address quantum control problems on
near-term quantum platforms.

Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of
classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection
to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling
constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack
rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control
framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while
providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online
conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation
sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum
magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the
required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The
results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum
algorithms with online conformal inference to achieve reliable quantum sensing
on NISQ devices.

Conclusion: 光子非线性相互作用是提升QOMG灵敏度的有效量子资源，对未来高性能QOMG的开发具有广泛影响。

Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to enhance the sensitivity of a quantum
optomechanical gyroscope (QOMG) by optical Kerr effect. We utilize quantum
Fisher information (QFI) to evaluate the metrological potential of the QOMG
scheme. It is found that the Kerr interaction can significantly enhances the
sensitivity of the QOMG. We observe the super-Hesenberg scaling of parameter
estimation precision. Furthermore, we also evaluate the performance of QOMG for
the quadrature measurement. It is indicated that the sensitivity in the
quadrature measurement scheme can saturate the quantum Crmam\'{e}r-Rao bound.
We study the effect of the driving and dissipation of the optical cavity on the
QFI, and find that the sensitivity can be manipulated by changing the driving
while dissipation decreases the sensitivity. The work shows that the photon
nonlinear interaction can improve sensitivity of QOMG, and demonstrates a
valuable quantum resource for the QOMG. These results could have a wide-ranging
impact on developing high-performance QOMG in the future.

Conclusion: 光电子自旋检测在单光子电离中可有效揭示手性分子的多极电流，为研究分子手性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward
asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light
polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with
circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents
resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two
mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$
and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and
two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection
reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents already in the one-photon regime
since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$
and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon
ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules via
circularly polarized light and show that the resulting spin-resolved current
has three components whose magnitudes are comparable and can be larger than
PECD: (i) a spin-polarization vortex in the plane of light polarization that
rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers, (ii) either a
spin-sink or source in the plane of light polarization for opposite
enantiomers, and (iii) a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism

Abstract: Long coherence times rank among the most important performance measures for
many different types of quantum technology. In NV centers of diamond, the
nuclear spins provide particularly long dephasing times. However, since
initialization and readout require assistance from the electron spin, the
apparent dephasing times can be reduced by the electron spin lifetime. Here we
propose and implement schemes for measuring and extending the dephasing times
of nuclear spins, resulting in dephasing times that are longer than the
longitudinal relaxation time $T_{1}$ of the electron spin.

Conclusion: 研究证明AMO量子比特在大规模算法中的可行性。

Abstract: Atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) approaches to quantum computing are
promising due to their increased connectivity, long coherence times and
apparent scalability. However, they have a significantly reduced cadence of
syndrome extraction compared to superconducting devices, a potentially
crippling slow-down given the substantial logical gate counts required for
quantum advantage. Transversal logic, which exploits higher connectivity, has
the potential to significantly speed up the logical clock rate by reducing the
number of syndrome extraction rounds required, but current decoders for fast
transversal logic are not scalable. This is not just because existing decoders
are too slow to handle the large decoding volumes resulting from fast logic;
transversal logic breaks the key structural properties that make real-time
decoding of lattice surgery efficient. We introduce two new, windowed decoding
protocols for transversal logic in the surface code that restore modularity and
locality to the decoding problem. Using our protocols, we show that, with a
very small space overhead, our scalable decoders unlock an order of magnitude
speed-up for transversal logic compared to lattice surgery. Taken together, our
results provide key evidence for the viability of large-scale algorithms on AMO
qubits.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅揭示了噪声来源，还为量子比特校准、误差缓解和纠错提供了有用信息。

Abstract: Qubit noise and fluctuations of the noise over time are key factors limiting
the performance of quantum computers. Characterising them with high temporal
resolution is challenging due to multiple overlapping stochastic processes such
as discrete jumps and continuous drifts. Hence, experiments typically probe
individual sources of fluctuations rather than concurrent fluctuations caused
by multiple sources. To overcome this limitation we develop a framework
comprising a noise characterisation method with minimal measurements allowing
high temporal resolution, combined with a hierarchical discrete fluctuation
auto-segmentation tool to disentangle the overlapping fluctuations without
human intervention, enabling their characterisation and tracking over long
times. We show that on transmon qubits the method can track and disentangle
qubit frequency fluctuations with temporal resolution of a few tens of
milliseconds over hours. This enables us to identify the origins of the
fluctuations as overlapping charge parity and two-level-systems switching.
Beyond insights into the fluctuation origins, our method also provides
information that can be used to improve qubit calibration, error mitigation and
error correction.

Abstract: We investigate a nonequilibrium donor-acceptor quantum rectifier system
coupled to an anharmonic vibrational mode, treating the vibrational dynamics
both as a two-level system and as multilevel system. The time-dependent Fischer
information is then calculated by deriving a quantum master equation for the
reduced system dynamics. We estimate some key rectifier parameters, the donor
energy, the acceptor energy, and the vibrational frequency. We report that
there is an optimal time for estimating the donor and acceptor energy. However,
the anharmonic mode can be estimated better only in the steadystate. The
acceptor energy is found to be most precisely estimable, especially under
strong coupling and high bias. Donor energy shows limited sensitivity, while
vibrational frequency estimation benefits from low temperatures. This work
offers a theoretical foundation for enhancing parameter estimation in nanoscale
quantum devices, guiding future sensing and metrological applications in
quantronic systems.

Conclusion: fluxonium作为控制量子比特具有显著优势，有望消除有害的非线性效应，为超导谐振腔的量子纠错提供高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Bosonic codes in superconducting resonators are a hardware-efficient avenue
for quantum error correction and can harness the favorable error hierarchies
provided by long-lived cavities compared to typical superconducting qubits.
These benefits can be negated, however, by the necessary coupling to an
ancillary control qubit, which often induces highly detrimental effects such as
excess decoherence and undesired nonlinearities. It is thus an important
question whether a qubit-cavity coupling can be realized that avoids such
effects. Here, we investigate the fluxonium as control qubit, motivated by its
long lifetime and controllability of Hamiltonian parameters that suggest an
avenue toward controlled elimination of undesired nonlinearities. In a
proof-of-concept experiment we use the fluxonium to measure the coherence
properties of a storage resonator and demonstrate the predictability of the
cavity's inherited nonlinearities from the fluxonium. We demonstrate universal
control by preparing and characterizing resonator Fock states and their
superpositions using selective number-dependent arbitrary phase gates. The
fidelities of state preparation and tomography are accounted for by incoherent
resonator decay errors in our planar prototype device. Finally, we predict that
the fluxonium can achieve beneficial cavity-coupling regimes compared to the
transmon, with the potential to eliminate undesirable cavity nonlinearities.
These results demonstrate the potential of the fluxonium as a high-performance
bosonic control qubit for superconducting cavities.

Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable
spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$
chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow
us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two
sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements
between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as
eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing
on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with
the exponential decay as $\exp(-L
|{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution
functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the
observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel
distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in
different macrostates decay faster as
$\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with
${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel

single-photon emission of molecular beam epitaxy grown semiconductor quantum

a InGaAs matrix with fixed indium content grown on top of a compositionally
graded InGaAs buffer. This structure allows for the future implementation of
electrically contacted nanocavities to enable high-quality and bright QD
emission. In detailed optical characterizations we observe linewidths as low as
$ 50 \mu$eV, close to the spectrometer resolution limit, low fine structure
splittings close to $ 10 \mu$eV, and $g^{(2)} (0)$ values as low as $0.08$.
These results advance the current performance metrics for MBE-grown quantum

Abstract: In a recent experiment, flux dependent oscillations of the quantum
capacitance were observed in a one dimensional spin-orbit coupled semiconductor
superconductor heterostructure connected end to end via a quantum dot and
threaded by a magnetic flux. In the topological superconducting phase of the
heterostructure, the oscillations corresponding to different fermion parity
sectors are shifted by half a period and can serve as a mechanism for fermion
parity readout or fusion operations involving a pair of localized, well
separated Majorana modes. In this work, we demonstrate that flux induced
fermion parity dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance in a
disordered semiconductor superconductor quantum dot system can originate not
only from topologically protected, spatially well separated Majorana zero modes
(MZMs) localized at the wire ends, but also, generically, from partially
separated Majorana modes with significant overlap, as well as from
quasi-Majorana modes in the topologically trivial phase, which can be viewed as
Andreev bound states whose constituent Majorana wave functions are slightly
shifted relative to each other and have nonzero amplitude at opposite ends of
the wire. Therefore, while the detection of flux dependent oscillations of
quantum capacitance marks an important experimental advance, such observations
alone do not constitute evidence of the presence of topological Majorana zero
modes.

Abstract: This book is a philosopher's introduction to the idea that our universe is
just one of many universes. I present and assess three versions of the idea:
one version from philosophy, and two from physics. In short, they are: all the
logically possible worlds; all the branches of the quantum state, in an
Everettian interpretation of quantum theory; and all the bubbles of
inflationary cosmology. For each proposal, I choose one main philosophical
question to discuss in depth. They are, respectively: what is a possible world;
what is chance; and what is explanation. But before treating these proposals
and their associated questions, I set the stage by reviewing physics and
philosophy from about 1600 to about 1900; and a final Chapter compares and
contrasts the proposals.

Abstract: Quantum computing has demonstrated potential for solving computationally
intensive problems more efficiently than classical methods. Many software
engineering tasks, such as test case selection, static analysis, code clone
detection, and defect prediction, involve complex optimization, search, or
classification, making them candidates for quantum enhancement. In this paper,
we propose Quantum-Based Software Engineering (QBSE), a potential research
direction for applying quantum computing to classical software engineering
problems. We outline its scope, clarify its distinction from quantum software
engineering (QSE), and identify key problem types that may benefit from quantum
optimization, search, and learning techniques. We also summarize existing
research efforts that remain fragmented. Finally, we sketch a preliminary
research agenda that may help guide the future development of QBSE as a
structured and meaningful direction within software engineering.

Result: 观察到短波长磁振子寿命超过18微秒。

Conclusion: 磁振子可作为现代固态量子计算平台的数据载体。

Abstract: Coherence time is the property of a quantum system that determines how long a
state can hold quantum information. This parameter is directly bound to their
lifetime in solid-state systems, where quantum information could be stored in
quasiparticles. For decades, quasiparticles associated with magnetization order
disturbance - magnons, had reported lifetimes below one microsecond at
gigahertz frequencies, restricting their use as a quantum information carrier.
Here, we report on the observation of short-wavelength magnons with lifetimes
exceeding 18{\mu}s at millikelvin temperatures. The experiment has been
performed in an ultra-pure single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet sphere in a wide
range of temperatures from ambient down to 30 mK. Our results open doors for
using magnons as data carriers in modern solid-state quantum computing
platforms.

Conclusion: 通过分析不同干涉仪的输出信号，论文为时空波动的检测提供了理论支持，并指出了不同仪器的适用场景。

Abstract: Spacetime fluctuations (SFs), a common feature of different proposed gravity
models, could be detected using laser interferometers. In the search for SFs, a
correspondence between the expected output signals and different gravity models
is needed, both for guiding the design of future interferometers, and for
identifying the signal in experimental data. In this work, we provide such a
correspondence for some classes of SFs and geometries of the interferometers.
We consider three different classes of SFs, characterised by the decay
behaviours and symmetries of their two-point correlation functions. Our
approach applies to Michelson laser interferometers with Fabry-P\'erot arm
cavities such as the km-long LIGO detectors and those without arm cavities such
as the laboratory-scale setups QUEST and GQuEST. Analysing the expected
interferometer output signals, we identify three characteristic signatures for
each class of SF. The designed broadband sensitivity of the laboratory-scale
instruments would allow all characteristic signatures of the different classes
of SFs to be observed, and such observations could provide more information on
the nature of the SFs than those from LIGO. On the other hand, we find that
LIGO is better suited for detecting the bare presence or absence of SFs.

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are a cornerstone of many-body physics at low
temperatures but have remained elusive far from equilibrium. Driven open
quantum systems -- a prominent non-equilibrium platform where coherent dynamics
competes with Markovian dissipation from the environment -- often exhibit an
effective classical behavior. In this work, we present a nontrivial quantum
phase transition that is stabilized, rather than destroyed, by Markovian
dissipation. We consider a variant of the paradigmatic spin-boson model where
the spin is driven and bosons are subject to Markovian loss proportional to
frequency (hence, vanishing at low frequencies). We show that the steady state
exhibits a localization phase transition where the spin's dynamics is frozen,
to be contrasted with the ground-state transition in the absence of
dissipation. Furthermore, this transition occurs when the steady state becomes
pure. The latter is not simply a dark state of dissipation but rather emerges
from a nontrivial renormalization of the spin dynamics by low-frequency bosonic
modes. Our work provides a nontrivial example where quantumness, typically
reserved for ground states, also emerges in dynamical settings, with potential
applications in quantum computation.

Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays
a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose
a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in
even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on
constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the
original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via
reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A
key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian
specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the
dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH
systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7,
L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from
the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin
textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH
Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional
systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work
establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological
invariants in quantum platforms.

Abstract: Atom interferometers deployed in space are excellent tools for high precision
measurements, navigation, or Earth observation. In particular, differential
interferometric setups feature common-mode noise suppression and enable
reliable measurements in the presence of ambient platform noise. Here we report
on orbital magnetometry campaigns performed with differential single- and
double-loop interferometers in NASA's Cold Atom Lab aboard the International
Space Station. By comparing measurements with atoms in magnetically sensitive
and insensitive states, we have realized atomic magnetometers mapping magnetic
field curvatures. Our results pave the way towards precision quantum sensing
missions in space.
