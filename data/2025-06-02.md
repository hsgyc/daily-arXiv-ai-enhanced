### [2] [A complexity theory for non-local quantum computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23893)
*Andreas Bluhm,Simon Höfer,Alex May,Mikka Stasiuk,Philip Verduyn Lunel,Henry Yuen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了非局域量子计算（NLQC）中的资源需求，通过间接方法比较不同任务的相对难度，证明了两种主要任务（$f$-measure和$f$-route）在常数开销下等价，并扩展了$f$-measure的新性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLQC的纠缠成本研究存在复杂性理论障碍，但作者希望通过间接方法理解其资源需求，类似于复杂性理论中的任务归约方法。

Method: 通过资源高效的归约方法，比较不同NLQC任务的相对难度，重点研究了$f$-measure和$f$-route的等价性。

Result: 证明了$f$-measure和$f$-route在常数开销下等价，简化了现有证明，并为$f$-measure提供了新的上界和高效协议。

Conclusion: 该研究为NLQC任务的关系提供了新见解，简化了理论框架，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Non-local quantum computation (NLQC) replaces a local interaction between two
systems with a single round of communication and shared entanglement. Despite
many partial results, it is known that a characterization of entanglement cost
in at least certain NLQC tasks would imply significant breakthroughs in
complexity theory. Here, we avoid these obstructions and take an indirect
approach to understanding resource requirements in NLQC, which mimics the
approach used by complexity theorists: we study the relative hardness of
different NLQC tasks by identifying resource efficient reductions between them.
Most significantly, we prove that $f$-measure and $f$-route, the two best
studied NLQC tasks, are in fact equivalent under $O(1)$ overhead reductions.
This result simplifies many existing proofs in the literature and extends
several new properties to $f$-measure. For instance, we obtain sub-exponential
upper bounds on $f$-measure for all functions, and efficient protocols for
functions in the complexity class $\mathsf{Mod}_k\mathsf{L}$. Beyond this, we
study a number of other examples of NLQC tasks and their relationships.

### [3] [How to Verify that a Small Device is Quantum, Unconditionally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23978)
*Giulio Malavolta,Tamer Mour*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出两种新的量子证明（PoQ）协议，通过限制对手的内存而非运行时间来确保无条件安全性。第一种协议基于Raz的内存下界，具有二次内存差距；第二种协议利用有界存储模型技术，实现指数级内存差距。两种协议均高效可验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在仅限制对手内存的条件下，构建无条件安全的量子证明协议，以验证量子计算的不可经典模拟性。

Method: 1. 基于Raz矩阵求逆内存下界的简单协议，使用模2算术实现。2. 利用有界存储模型技术构建的协议，实现指数级内存差距。

Result: 提出两种协议：第一种简单且依赖少量量子门；第二种实现更高内存差距。两种协议均高效可验证。

Conclusion: 通过限制内存而非运行时间，成功构建无条件安全的PoQ协议，为量子验证提供新思路。

Abstract: A proof of quantumness (PoQ) allows a classical verifier to efficiently test
if a quantum machine is performing a computation that is infeasible for any
classical machine. In this work, we propose a new approach for constructing PoQ
protocols where soundness holds unconditionally assuming a bound on the memory
of the prover, but otherwise no restrictions on its runtime. In this model, we
propose two protocols:
  1. A simple protocol with a quadratic gap between the memory required by the
honest parties and the memory bound of the adversary. The soundness of this
protocol relies on Raz's (classical) memory lower bound for matrix inversion
(Raz, FOCS 2016).
  2. A protocol that achieves an exponential gap, building on techniques from
the literature on the bounded storage model (Dodis et al., Eurocrypt 2023).
  Both protocols are also efficiently verifiable. Despite having worse
asymptotics, our first protocol is conceptually simple and relies only on
arithmetic modulo 2, which can be implemented with one-qubit Hadamard and CNOT
gates, plus a single one-qubit non-Clifford gate.

### [4] [Assessment of Polarization Entanglement Source: Photon Counting and Correlation Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23979)
*Tomáš Novák,Martin Guldan,Josef Vojtěch,Josef Blažej*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全面的测试框架，用于认证和测试商业化的偏振纠缠光子源，重点关注光子计数和相关性测量，并考虑了检测设备的非理想性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市场上已有商用偏振纠缠光子源，但缺乏认证或第三方测试，因此需要一种可扩展且可重复的测试方法。

Method: 通过量子态层析（QST）、偏振可见性测量、时间相关性测量等方法，结合严格的概率分析，评估光子源的性能。

Result: 讨论了真/假符合计数的界限及其对量子比特错误率（QBER）的影响，并比较了三种商用光源的测试结果。

Conclusion: 虽然QST测量复杂，但直接测量方法的其他统计量仍能有效评估偏振纠缠程度。

Abstract: Commercial sources of polarization entanglement at telecommunication
wavelengths are already available on the market, but they lack proper
certification or third-party testing. We aim to provide a comprehensive testing
framework for photon counting and correlation measurements to characterize the
parameters of these sources in a scalable and repeatable manner. The detection
setup is included in our considerations, as the non-idealities of the
components negatively affect the relevance of the measurement results. We
discuss bounds for both true and false coincidences with rigorous probabilistic
approach, as their ratio directly impacts the resolution of coincidence
measurements and is reflected in Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) in the quantum
telecommunication system. Quantum State Tomography (QST), polarization
visibility measurements, temporal correlations measurements, and computations
of other statistics are to be performed and compared at the state-of-the-art
level for a three commercially available sources. Given that QST is demanding
in terms of number of measurements and post-processing analysis, we discuss the
relevance of determining the degree of polarization entanglement considering
solely other statistics of direct measurement approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示标准量子力学中量子态概念的多重定义之间的不一致性及其对理论物理理解的负面影响。

Method: 通过分析标准量子力学（SQM）的量子态定义，揭示其内在矛盾和不一致性。

Result: 发现量子态概念在SQM中存在多重且不一致的定义，导致自相矛盾的陈述和错误结论。

Conclusion: 量子态概念在理论物理中的合理性受到质疑，其定义的不一致性使其难以作为理性理解的基础。

Abstract: The notion of quantum state plays a fundamental role within the Standard
account of Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as established by Dirac and von Neumann
during 1930s and up to the present. In this work we expose the deep
inconsistencies that exist within the multiple definitions of the notion of
quantum state that are provided within this axiomatic formulation. As we will
argue, these different inconsistent definitions continue to be -- even today --
uncritically confused within the mainstream physical and philosophical
literature leading to self-contradictory statements and wrong conclusions. We
end with a discussion regarding the untenability of this concept for any
rational understanding of theoretical physics.

Result: 主要结果是通过非上下文分布表征单纯分布间的凸映射，扩展了范畴量子基础中的先前结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子上下文性提供了更广泛的资源理论框架，并扩展了现有理论结果。

Abstract: We develop a resource theory of contextuality within the framework of
symmetric monoidal categories, extending recent simplicial approaches to
quantum contextuality. Building on the theory of simplicial distributions,
which integrates homotopy-theoretic structures with probability, we introduce
event scenarios as a functorial generalization of presheaf-theoretic
measurement scenarios and prove their equivalence to bundle scenarios via the
Grothendieck construction. We define symmetric monoidal structures on these
categories and extend the distribution functor to a stochastic setting,
yielding a resource theory that generalizes the presheaf-theoretic notion of
simulations. Our main result characterizes convex maps between simplicial
distributions in terms of non-contextual distributions on a corresponding
mapping scenario, enhancing and extending prior results in categorical quantum
foundations.

Result: 算法能够有效调节干涉仪，无需精确解析解，支持新架构的探索。

Conclusion: 该方法为光学干涉仪的灵活调节和新架构设计提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We have developed an algorithm that constructs a model of a reconfigurable
optical interferometer, independent of specific architectural constraints. The
programming of unitary transformations on the interferometer's optical modes
relies on either an analytical method for deriving the unitary matrix from a
set of phase shifts or an optimization routine when such decomposition is not
available. Our algorithm employs a supervised learning approach, aligning the
interferometer model with a training set derived from the device being studied.
A straightforward optimization procedure leverages this trained model to
determine the phase shifts of the interferometer with a specific architecture,
obtaining the required unitary transformation. This approach enables the
effective tuning of interferometers without requiring a precise analytical
solution, paving the way for the exploration of new interferometric circuit
architectures.

Abstract: Correlated emission of light offer a potential avenue for entanglement
generation between atomic spins, with potential application for sensing and
quantum memory. In this work, we investigate the conditions for the correlated
emission by color centers into an electronic bath of conduction electrons.
Unlike emission into bosonic modes, electrons can absorb energy via
two-particle processes across a large range of length scales. We find that two
length scales are particularly relevant: one set by the Fermi velocity and the
frequency of the color centers $v_F/\Delta$, and the other set by the Fermi
wavelength $\lambda_F \ll v_F/\Delta$. Subradiance requires emitters to be
spaced at a distance closer than the Fermi wavelength, while superradiance
requires spacing less than $\sqrt{\lambda_F v_F/\Delta}$, so long as the
emitters are initialized with coherence. We show that the emitted current burst
has a spiral form, and we discuss the experimental possibility to observe
correlated dissipation by color-center qubits coupled to electronic
environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为全光纤偏振敏感接收器提供了一种有效的解决方案，并提升了量子通信的安全性。

Abstract: Polarization-sensitive receivers for single photons are of crucial importance
in various applications within the fields of quantum communication and quantum
sensing, and are more commonly implemented in free-space optics rather than in
optical fibers. This is primarily due to the unpredictable and varying
birefringence in single-mode optical fibers. We present a method for
birefringence compensation in an all-fiber detection setup that relies solely
on coincidence measurements of a polarization-entangled state, or known
correlations in a prepare-and-measure scenario. We define coincidence entropies
as functions of the measured coincidence counts. These quantify the randomness
of measurement outcomes, remain independent of the transmitted Bell state, and
serve as indicators of the degree of entanglement. By leveraging coincidence
entropy as a cost function in a gradient descent algorithm, we are able to
align the polarization bases between two distinct polarization-sensitive
receivers. Additionally, coincidence entropies can be employed to monitor the
quality of entanglement transmission, thereby enhancing the system's ability to
detect potential eavesdropping attempts, such as intercept-resend quantum
attacks.

Motivation: 探索如何利用Purcell效应提升激光冷却效率，突破现有温度限制。

Method: 采用量子力学框架，模拟Yb3+离子在YLiF4基质中的行为，结合腔诱导的发射截面修正，计算最低温度和冷却效率。

Result: 在100K以下温度，冷却效率显著提升，最低温度低于现有极限；考虑Purcell抑制效应后，冷却效率提升25%至65%。

Conclusion: Purcell效应能显著改善反斯托克斯激光冷却性能，为低温冷却技术提供新思路。

Abstract: We investigate the improvement of anti-Stokes laser cooling of a
Yb$^{3+}$:YLF nanocrystal in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity via the Purcell
effect. Our analysis accounts for both the enhancement of emission lines
resonant with the cavity transmission and the suppression of off-resonance
emissions. Using a quantum-mechanical framework, we modeled the Yb$^{3+}$ ions
in a YLiF$_4$ matrix and the laser system to calculate the minimum achievable
temperature and cooling efficiency, incorporating cavity-induced modifications
to experimental data on emission cross section. Our results indicate that for
temperatures below 100~K, the cooling efficiency ($\eta_c$) is consistently
enhanced, and the minimum achievable temperature is reduced comfortably below
the current limits. We also show how the inclusion of Purcell inhibition
effects can lead to improvements in the cooling efficiency ranging from 25\% to
65\%, with respect to the case when only Purcell enhancement is considered.

*Shuohao Ping,Naren Sathishkumar,Wan-Hsuan Lin,Hanyu Wang,Jason Cong*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: ML-SABRE是一种高性能的多层次量子布局合成框架，通过分层优化显著减少SWAP开销和编译时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有启发式工具效率高但解质量不足，精确方法可扩展性差，需改进。

Method: 采用多层次框架，结合LightSABRE启发式方法，分层优化。

Result: SWAP开销减少60%，电路深度减少17%，编译时间减少60%，最优性差距显著缩小。

Conclusion: ML-SABRE适用于规模增大和架构复杂的量子设备。

Abstract: Quantum Layout Synthesis (QLS) is a critical compilation stage that adapts
quantum circuits to hardware constraints with an objective of minimizing the
SWAP overhead. While heuristic tools demonstrate good efficiency, they often
produce suboptimal solutions, and exact methods suffer from limited
scalability. In this work, we propose ML-SABRE, a high-performance multilevel
framework for QLS that improves both solution quality and compilation time
through a hierarchical optimization approach. We employ the state-of-the-art
heuristic method, LightSABRE, at all levels to ensure both efficiency and
performance. Our evaluation on real benchmarks and hardware architectures shows
that ML-SABRE decreases SWAP count by over 60%, circuit depth by 17%, and
delivers a 60% compilation time reduction compared to state-of-the-art solvers.
Further optimality studies reveal that ML-SABRE can significantly reduce the
optimality gap by up to 82% for SWAP count and 49% for circuit depth, making it
well-suited for emerging quantum devices with increasing size and architectural
complexity.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 非变分量子行走优化算法（non-variational QWOA）在加权最大割问题上的基准测试结果显示，其性能优于经典启发式算法，并可能实现量子优势。

Motivation: 研究非变分QWOA在NP难优化问题中的性能表现，探索其是否具有量子优势。

Method: 通过经典模拟测试非变分QWOA在加权最大割问题上的性能，问题规模达n=31。

Result: 非变分QWOA在全局最优解上的测量概率保持恒定，优于经典启发式算法的衰减性能。

Conclusion: 非变分QWOA在问题规模扩展时表现更优，但需进一步验证其在更大规模和其他问题上的表现。

Abstract: We present benchmarking results for the non-variational Quantum Walk
Optimisation Algorithm (non-variational QWOA) applied to the weighted maxcut
problem, using classical simulations for problem sizes up to $n = 31$. The
amplified quantum state, prepared using a quadratic number of alternating
unitaries, achieves a constant average-case measurement probability for
globally optimal solutions across these problem sizes. This behaviour contrasts
with that of classical heuristics, which, for NP-hard optimisation problems,
typically exhibit solve probabilities that decay as problem size increases.
Performance comparisons with two local-search heuristics on the same benchmark
instances suggest that the non-variational QWOA may offer a meaningful
advantage by scaling more favourably with problem size. These results provide
supporting evidence for the potential of this quantum heuristic to achieve
quantum advantage, though further work is needed to assess whether the observed
performance scaling persists at larger problem sizes, and to confirm whether
similar performance trends are observed for the other problem classes to which
the non-variational QWOA is designed to generalise.

Result: 算法实现了最优的Θ(n)深度和Θ(n²)门数，且仅需Θ(n²)经典开销。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了采样FLO的效率，适用于多种量子信息应用。

Abstract: Sampling unitary Fermionic Linear Optics (FLO), or matchgate circuits, has
become a fundamental tool in quantum information. Such capability enables a
large number of applications ranging from randomized benchmarking of continuous
gate sets, to fermionic classical shadows. In this work, we introduce optimal
algorithms to sample over the non-particle-preserving (active) and
particle-preserving (passive) FLO Haar measures. In particular, we provide
appropriate distributions for the gates of $n$-qubit parametrized circuits
which produce random active and passive FLO. In contrast to previous
approaches, which either incur classical $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ compilation costs
or have suboptimal depths, our methods directly output circuits which
simultaneously achieve an optimal down-to-the-constant-factor $\Theta(n)$ depth
and $\Theta(n^2)$ gate count; with only a $\Theta(n^2)$ classical overhead.
Finally, we also provide quantum circuits to sample Clifford FLO with an
optimal $\Theta(n^2)$ gate count.

Result: 新估计器在资源复杂度上优于先前基于蒸馏的估计器。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子网络中的资源估计提供了一种高效且低开销的解决方案。

Abstract: With the advent of practical quantum communication networks drawing closer,
there is a growing need for reliable estimation protocols that can efficiently
characterize quantum resources with minimum resource overhead requirement. A
novel approach to this problem is to integrate an estimator into an existing
network task, thereby removing the need for an additional characterization
protocol. In this work, we show that the measurement statistics of a double
selection distillation protocol alone can be used to efficiently estimate the
Bell-diagonal parameters of the undistilled states, as well as the resulting
distilled states after additional post-processing. We also demonstrate that
this novel estimator outperforms the previously proposed distillation-based
estimator in terms of resource complexity.

Abstract: We propose a revisited variational quantum solver for linear systems,
designed to circumvent the barren plateau phenomenon by combining two key
techniques: adiabatic evolution and warm starts. To this end, we define an
initial Hamiltonian with a known ground state which is easily implemented on
the quantum circuit, and then "adiabatically" evolve the Hamiltonian by tuning
a control variable in such a way that the final ground state matches the
solution to the given linear system. This evolution is carried out in
incremental steps, and the ground state at each step is found by minimizing the
energy using the parameter values corresponding to the previous minimum as a
warm start to guide the search. As a first test case, the method is applied to
several linear systems obtained by discretizing a one-dimensional heat flow
equation with different physical assumptions and grid choices. Our method
successfully and reliably improves upon the solution to the same problem as
obtained by a conventional quantum solver, reaching very close to the global
minimum also in the case of very shallow circuit implementations.

Conclusion: 通过特定量子共轭，不可区分粒子在不同统计下可表现出相似行为，为量子模拟化学键提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The permutation symmetry is a fundamental attribute of the collective
wavefunction of indistinguishable particles. It makes a difference for the
behavior of collective systems having different quantum statistics but existing
in the same environment. Here we show that for some specific quantum
conjugation between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom the
indistinguishable particles can behave similarly for either quantum statistics.
In particular, a mesoscopically scaled collection of atomic qubits, mediated by
optical tweezers, can model the behavior of a valent electronic shell
compounded with nuclear centers in molecules. This makes possible quantum
simulations of mono and divalent bonds in quantum chemistry by manipulation of
up to four bosonic atoms confined with optical microtraps.

Abstract: The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is
useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical
generalized Ising models.
  We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge
conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$).
  A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata
(PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions.
  Two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for
Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions.
  Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables.
  For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field
operators for particle excitations.
  These automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to
thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution.
  PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize
a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with
interactions.
  For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on
deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.

Abstract: This study explores the effects of introducing a symmetry breaking disorder
on the dynamics of a system invariant under particle permutation. The disorder
forces quantum states, confined to the $N+1$ dimensional completely symmetric
space to penetrate the exponentially large $2^N$ dimensional Hilbert space of
$N$ particles. In particular, we focus on the quantum kicked top as a Floquet
system of $N$ qubits, and use linear entropy, measuring single qubit
entanglement, to investigate the changes in the time scales and values of
saturation when disorder is introduced. In the near-integrable regime of the
kicked top, we study the robustness of quantum revivals to disorder. We also
find that a classical calculation yields the quantum single qubit entanglement
to remarkable accuracy in the disorder free limit. The disorder, on the other
hand, is modeled in the form of noise which again fits well with the numerical
calculations. We measure the extent to which the dynamics is retained within
the symmetric subspace and its spreading to the full Hilbert space using
different quantities. We show that increasing disorder drives the system to a
chaotic phase in full Hilbert space, as also supported by the spectral
statistics. We find that there is robustness to disorder in the system, and
this is a function of how chaotic the kicked top is.

Conclusion: 揭示了松弛速率约束的更深层次结构，并探讨了其与量子过程稳态数的联系。

Abstract: Relaxation rates are key characteristics of quantum processes, as they
determine how quickly a quantum system thermalizes, equilibrates, decoheres,
and dissipates. While they play a crucial role in theoretical analyses,
relaxation rates are also often directly accessible through experimental
measurements. Recently, it was shown that for quantum processes governed by
Markovian semigroups, the relaxation rates satisfy a universal constraint: the
maximal rate is upper-bounded by the sum of all rates divided by the dimension
of the Hilbert space. This bound, initially conjectured a few years ago, was
only recently proven using classical Lyapunov theory. In this work, we present
a new, purely algebraic proof of this constraint. Remarkably, our approach is
not only more direct but also allows for a natural generalization beyond
completely positive semigroups. We show that complete positivity can be relaxed
to 2-positivity without affecting the validity of the constraint. This reveals
that the bound is more subtle than previously understood: 2-positivity is
necessary, but even when further relaxed to Schwarz maps, a slightly weaker --
yet still non-trivial -- universal constraint still holds. Finally, we explore
the connection between these bounds and the number of steady states in quantum
processes, uncovering a deeper structure underlying their behavior.

Conclusion: 方法适用于受局部振幅阻尼噪声影响的贝尔态和高能碰撞中的自旋关联，展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We quantify and optimize the predictability of local observables in bipartite
quantum systems by employing the Bayes risk and the inference variance, two
measures rooted in statistical learning theory. Specifically, we minimized
these quantities when the prediction is improved by an additional quantum
system, providing analytical expressions for arbitrary two-qubit states, and
showcasing a connection with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criteria. Then,
we embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key
distribution protocol, yielding asymptotically higher secure-key rates than
standard BB84 under realistic noise. We applied these results to Bell states
affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and spin correlation in top-antitop
quark pairs from high-energy collisions.

Result: 在特定条件下，驱动transmon与TLS的相互作用可建模为随机扩散过程。

Conclusion: 驱动transmon可能成为多量子比特系统中的噪声源，需进一步优化驱动策略以减少负面影响。

Abstract: Under strong drives, which are becoming necessary for fast high-fidelity
operations, transmons can be structurally unstable. Due to chaotic effects, the
computational manifold is no longer well separated from the remainder of the
spectrum, which correlates with enhanced offset-charge sensitivity and
destructive effects in readout. We show here that these detrimental effects can
further propagate to other degrees of freedom, for example to neighboring
qubits in a multi-qubit system. Specifically, a coherently driven transmon can
act as a source of incoherent noise to another circuit element coupled to it.
By using a full quantum model and a semiclassical analysis, we perform the
noise spectroscopy of the driven transmon coupled to a spectator two-level
system (TLS), and we show that, in a certain limit, the interaction with the
driven transmon can be modeled as a stochastic diffusive process driving the
TLS.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of vector magnetic fields is critical for applications
including navigation, geoscience, and space exploration. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
center spin ensembles offer a promising solution for high-sensitivity vector
magnetometry, as their different orientations in the diamond lattice measure
different components of the magnetic field. However, the bias magnetic field
typically used to separate signals from each NV orientation introduces
inaccuracy from drifts in permanent magnets or coils. Here, we present a novel
bias-field-free approach that labels the NV orientations via the direction of
the microwave (MW) field in a variable-pulse-duration Ramsey sequence used to
manipulate the spin ensemble. Numerical simulations demonstrate the possibility
to isolate each orientation's signal with sub-nT accuracy even without precise
MW field calibration, at only a moderate cost to sensitivity. We also provide
proof-of-principle experimental validation, observing relevant features that
evolve as expected with applied magnetic field. Looking forward, by removing a
key source of drift, the proposed protocol lays the groundwork for future
deployment of NV magnetometers in high-accuracy or long-duration missions.

Conclusion: 量子Label Switch是一种通用方法，可将任何双结果测量转化为α-LGM，达到理论界限。

Abstract: Gentle measurements of quantum states do not entirely collapse the initial
state. Instead, they provide a post-measurement state at a prescribed trace
distance $\alpha$ from the initial state together with a random variable used
for quantum learning of the initial state. We introduce here the class of
$\alpha-$locally-gentle measurements ($\alpha-$LGM) on a finite dimensional
quantum system which are product measurements on product states and prove a
strong quantum Data-Processing Inequality (qDPI) on this class using an
improved relation between gentleness and quantum differential privacy. We
further show a gentle quantum Neyman-Pearson lemma which implies that our qDPI
is asymptotically optimal (for small $\alpha$). This inequality is employed to
show that the necessary number of quantum states for prescribed accuracy
$\epsilon$ is of order $1/(\epsilon^2 \alpha^2)$ for both quantum tomography
and quantum state certification. Finally, we propose an $\alpha-$LGM called
quantum Label Switch that attains these bounds. It is a general implementable
method to turn any two-outcome measurement into an $\alpha-$LGM.

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum thermodynamics in the Gaussian regime provides a
promising framework for investigating the energetic role of quantum
correlations, particularly in optical systems. In this work, we introduce an
entropy-free criterion for entanglement detection in bipartite Gaussian states,
rooted in a distinct thermodynamic quantity: ergotropy -- the maximum
extractable work via unitary operations. By defining the relative ergotropic
gap, which quantifies the disparity between global and local ergotropy, we
derive two independent analytical bounds that distinguish entangled from
separable states. We show that for a broad class of quantum states, the bounds
coincide, making the criterion both necessary and sufficient. We further extend
our analysis to certain non-Gaussian states and observe analogous energy-based
signatures of quantum correlations. These findings establish a direct
operational link between entanglement and energy storage, offering an
experimentally accessible approach to entanglement detection in
continuous-variable optical platforms.

Abstract: Existing quantum discrete adiabatic approaches are hindered by circuit depth
that increases linearly with the number of evolution steps, a significant
challenge for current quantum hardware with limited coherence times. To address
this, we propose a co-designed framework that synergistically integrates
dynamic circuit capabilities with real-time classical processing. This
framework reformulates the quantum adiabatic evolution into discrete,
dynamically adjustable segments. The unitary operator for each segment is
optimized on-the-fly using classical computation, and circuit multiplexing
techniques are leveraged to reduce the overall circuit depth scaling from
\(O(\text{steps}\times\text{depth}(U))\) to \(O(\text{depth}(U))\). We
implement and benchmark a quantum discrete adiabatic linear solver based on
this framework for linear systems of \(W \in {2,4,8,16}\) dimensions with
condition numbers \(\kappa \in {10,20,30,40,50}\). Our solver successfully
overcomes previous depth limitations, maintaining over \(80\%\) solution
fidelity even under realistic noise models. Key algorithmic optimizations
contributing to this performance include a first-order approximation of the
discrete evolution operator, a tailored dynamic circuit design exploiting
real-imaginary component separation, and noise-resilient post-processing
techniques.

Abstract: The super-additivity of quantum channel capacity is an important feature of
quantum information theory different from classical theory, which has been
attracting attention. Recently a special channel called ``platypus channel''
exhibits super-additive quantum capacity when combined with qudit erasure
channels. Here we consider the ``generalized platypus channel'', prove that it
has computable channel capacities, such as both private and classical capacity
equal to $1$, and in particular, the generalized platypus channel still
displays the super-additivity of quantum capacity when combined with qudit
erasure channels and multilevel amplitude damping channels respectively.

Abstract: Entanglement detection serves as a fundamental task in quantum information
science, playing a critical role in quantum benchmarking and foundational
studies. As the number of controllable qubits continues to increase, there
emerges a pressing demand for scalable and robust entanglement detection
protocols that can maintain high detection capability while requiring minimal
resources. By integrating the positive partial transposition criterion with
variational quantum interference, we develop an entanglement detection protocol
that requires moderate classical and quantum computation resources. Numerical
simulations demonstrate that this protocol attains high detection capability
using only shallow quantum circuits, outperforming several widely-used
entanglement detection methods. The protocol also exhibits strong resilience to
circuit noise, ensuring its applicability across different physical platforms.
Experimental implementation on a linear optical platform successfully
identifies entanglement in a three-qubit mixed state that cannot be detected by
conventional entanglement witnesses. Drawing upon the full potential of quantum
and classical resources, our protocol paves a new path for efficient
entanglement detection.

Abstract: We present a method to quantify entanglement in mixed states of highly
symmetric systems. Symmetry constrains interactions between parts and predicts
the degeneracies of the states. While symmetry alone produces entangled
eigenstates, the thermal mixed state (density) which contains all of the
eigenstate densities weighted by their Boltzmann factors is not necessarily as
entangled as the eigenstates themselves because generally the mixed state can
be re-expressed as a sum over densities which are less entangled. The
entanglement of the mixed state is the minimum obtained by considering all such
re-expressions, but there is no well-defined approach to solving this problem
generally. Our method uses symmetry to explicitly construct unentangled
densities, which are then optimally included in the thermal mixed state,
resulting in a quantitative measure of entanglement that accounts for the
reduction of entanglement arising from degenerate states. We present results
for several small spin systems.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide secure key material between two
parties without relying on assumptions about the computational power of an
eavesdropper. QKD is performed over quantum links and quantum networks, systems
which are resource-intensive to deploy and maintain. To evaluate and optimize
performance prior to, during, and after deployment, realistic simulations with
attention to physical realism are necessary. Quantum network simulators can
simulate a variety of quantum and classical protocols and can assist in quantum
network design and optimization by offering realism and flexibility beyond
mathematical models which rely on simplifying assumptions and can be
intractable to solve as network complexity increases. We use a versatile
discrete event quantum network simulator to simulate the entanglement-based QKD
protocol BBM92 and compare it to our experimental implementation and to
existing theory. Furthermore, we simulate secure key rates in a repeater key
distribution scenario for which no experimental implementations exist.

Abstract: Precise control of mechanical modes in the quantum regime is a key resource
for quantum technologies, offering promising pathways for quantum sensing with
macroscopic systems and scalable architectures for quantum simulation. In this
work, we realise a multimode mechanical cavity coupled to a superconducting
Kerr resonator, which induces nonlinearity in the mechanical modes. The Kerr
mode is realised by a flux-tunable SQUID array resonator, while the mechanical
modes are implemented by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavity. Both mechanical
and electromagnetic modes are individually addressable via dedicated
measurement lines, enabling full spectroscopic characterisation. We introduce a
straightforward protocol to measure the SQUID array resonator's participation
ratio in the hybrid acoustic modes, quantifying the degree of hybridisation.
The participation ratio reveals that our device operates at the onset of the
multimode coupling regime, where multiple acoustic modes simultaneously
interact with the nonlinear superconducting element. Furthermore, this platform
allows controllable Kerr-type nonlinearities in multiple acoustic modes, with
the participation ratio serving as the key parameter determining both the
dissipation rates and nonlinear strengths of these hybridised modes. Close to
the resonant regime, we measure a cross-Kerr interaction between seven pairs of
mechanical modes, which is controllable via the SQUID array resonator detuning.
These results establish a platform for engineering nonlinear multimode
mechanical interactions, offering potential for future integration with
superconducting qubits and implementation of multiple mechanical qubits.

Conclusion: 需开发更稳健的量子搜索策略以解决不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves.
However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the
efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary
(MBHB) systems. In this work, a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on
Grover's algorithm is applied to the MBHB signals. It is demonstrated that the
quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to
$O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank.
Simulated results indicate that the quantum-enhanced approach significantly
reduces computational costs. However, it is also found that the performance can
degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. This highlights the
need for more robust and stable quantum search strategies.

Abstract: The $KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$ spin model-originally derived for an ideal $P\bar{3}1m$
symmetric geometry-has long served as a central framework for understanding
candidate Kitaev materials. In realistic crystals, however, this ideal geometry
is seldom realized, either at low temperatures or under external perturbations,
limiting the model's quantitative applicability. Here we introduce a fully
generalized spin model, denoted $\epsilon$-$KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$, that explicitly
incorporates arbitrary lattice deformations $\epsilon$. All spin-exchange
interactions and their strain-dependent coefficients are obtained from
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and a microscopic derivation of
coupling constants for materials based on $d^5$ transition-metal ions. For
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under a strain of $3\%$, new emergent exchange channels
acquire magnitudes comparable to their unstrained counterparts. Building on
these parameters, we investigate strain-driven quantum phase transitions
between competing magnetic states-including the zigzag order and the Kitaev
quantum spin liquid (KQSL)-and identify a strain-induced topological transition
within the KQSL states that offers a practical diagnostic of Kitaev physics.
Furthermore, our symmetry analysis of the $\epsilon$-$KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$ model is
applicable to both $d^{5}$ ions, such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and $d^{7}$
systems, including cobalt-based compounds.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have been widely used in
computational physics to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). In this
study, we propose an energy-embedding-based physics-informed neural network
method for solving the one-dimensional time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger
equation to obtain ground- and excited-state wave functions, as well as energy
eigenvalues by incorporating an embedding layer to generate process-driven
data. The method demonstrates high accuracy for several well-known potentials,
such as the infinite potential well, harmonic oscillator potential, Woods-Saxon
potential, and double-well potential. Further validation shows that the method
also performs well in solving the radial Coulomb potential equation, showcasing
its adaptability and extensibility. The proposed approach can be extended to
solve other partial differential equations beyond the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
and holds promise for applications in high-dimensional quantum systems.

Abstract: Electrons floating on a solid neon exhibit long charge coherence times,
making them attractive for hybrid quantum systems. When combined with
high-quality, high-impedance superconducting resonators and a local magnetic
field gradient, this platform enables strong charge-photon and spin-charge
coupling -- key ingredients for scalable spin qubit architectures. In this
work, we fabricated NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators and measured
internal quality factors around $10^5$. We successfully deposited several
hundred-nanometer-thick layers of solid neon, followed by gradual electron
loading. The presence of neon and electrons was confirmed via resonance
frequency shifts without degradation of the resonator's quality factor. These
results demonstrate that NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators are
compatible with electrons-on-neon systems and suitable for future qubit
experiments. We further performed a theoretical analysis of optimized
micro-magnet configurations, showing that spin qubit gate fidelities exceeding
99.99% for single-qubit and 99.9% for two-qubit operations are achievable using
natural neon at the charge sweet spot.

Abstract: Bragg diffraction is a fundamental technique used to enhance the sensitivity
of atom interferometers through large momentum transfer, making these devices
among the most precise quantum sensors available today. To further improve
their accuracy, it is necessary to achieve control over multiple interferometer
paths and increase robustness against velocity spread. Optimal control theory
has recently led to advancements in sensitivity and robustness under specific
conditions, such as vibrations, accelerations, and other experimental
challenges. In this work, we employ this tool to focus on improving the
accuracy of the interferometer by minimizing the diffraction phase. We consider
the finite temperature of the incoming wavepacket and the multi-path nature of
high-order Bragg diffraction as showcased in a Mach-Zehnder(MZ) geometry. Our
approach can achieve diffraction phases on the order of microradians or even
below a microradian for a momentum width of the incoming wavepacket $\sigma_p =
0.01\hbar k$, below a milliradian for $\sigma_p= 0.1 \hbar k$ and milliradians
for $\sigma_p = 0.3 \hbar k$.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid progress of quantum sensing research reveals that the
Rydberg atoms have great potentials in becoming high-precision centimeter-scale
antenna of low-frequency fields. In order to facilitate efficient and reliable
detection of low-frequency fields via Rydberg atoms, we design, implement and
analyze a special but low-cost and scalable method based on heterodyning
processes under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)
embedded in typical two-photon ground-Rydberg transition. Instead of relying on
observing changes in absorption of light by Rydberg atoms, our method focuses
on the phase modulation effect on the probe laser induced by the low-frequency
fields via the Rydberg EIT mechanism and utilizes a demodulation process to
accurately retrieve the signal. The general principles of our method apply to
both electric and magnetic fields and it is even possible to realize the
combination of both functionalities in the same apparatus. In particular, we
experimentally demonstrate the full cycle of operations with respect to both
cases. In the measurement of low-frequency electric fields, we discover that
the Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction among atoms induce linear superposition
of Rydberg states with different angular momentum that generates a first-order
response corresponding to the signature of linear Stark effect. As the Rydberg
atoms have excellent coupling strengths with electric fields, our results
indicate that our method can hopefully reach high-precision performance for
practical tasks in the future.

Abstract: We investigate the roughening transition in the pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice
gauge theory in (2+1) dimensions. Using numerical simulations with matrix
product states, we explore the static and dynamical properties of an electric
flux string between two static charges as the coupling is varied and approaches
the deconfinement phase transition from the confined phase. Within the
roughening region, we obtain the universal L\"uscher correction to the
confining potential and observe the expected restoration of rotational
symmetry. Our simulations of the out-of-equilibrium evolution of a string
reveal that the growth of the entanglement entropy of the state and the string
width exhibit qualitatively different behavior in the roughening region
compared to the deeply confined one. In particular, we find that the rate of
entropy growth is consistent with an effective description of the string
excitations by a bosonic model in the roughening phase.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks converge faster and achieve higher accuracy than
classical models. However, data augmentation in quantum machine learning
remains underexplored. To tackle data scarcity, we integrate quantum generative
adversarial networks (QGANs) with hybrid quantum-classical neural networks
(HQCNNs) to develop an augmentation framework. We propose two strategies: a
general approach to enhance data processing and classification across HQCNNs,
and a customized strategy that dynamically generates samples tailored to the
HQCNN's performance on specific data categories, improving its ability to learn
from complex datasets. Simulation experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate
that QGAN outperforms traditional data augmentation methods and classical GANs.
Compared to baseline DCGAN, QGAN achieves comparable performance with half the
parameters, balancing efficiency and effectiveness. This suggests that QGANs
can simplify models and generate high-quality data, enhancing HQCNN accuracy
and performance. These findings pave the way for applying quantum data
augmentation techniques in machine learning.
