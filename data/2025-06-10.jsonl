Simulating fermionic systems is both a problem with clear\nreal-world applications and a computationally challenging task. In order to\nsimulate a system of fermions on a quantum computer, one has to first map the\nfermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian. The most popular such mapping is\nthe Jordan-Wigner encoding, which suffers from inefficiencies caused by the\nhigh weight of some encoded operators. As a result, alternative local encodings\nhave been proposed that solve this problem at the expense of a constant factor\nincrease in the number of qubits required. Some such encodings possess local\nstabilizers, i.e., Pauli operators that act as the logical identity on the\nencoded fermionic modes. A natural error mitigation approach in these cases is\nto measure the stabilizers and discard any run where a measurement returns a -1\noutcome. Using a high-performance stabilizer simulator, we classically simulate\nthe performance of a local encoding known as the Derby-Klassen encoding and\ncompare its performance with the Jordan-Wigner encoding and the ternary tree\nencoding.

As\nnatural invariants under the group, these structural properties of orbits alone\ncan reveal fundamental impossibilities of enacting certain unitary\ntransformations deterministically. We showcase a general and straightforward\nway to compute orbit dimensions for states of finite support in the Fock basis,\nby leveraging the group's Lie algebra. We also study genericity and robustness\nproperties of orbit dimensions, and propose approaches to efficiently evaluate\nthem experimentally. Besides, we highlight that the orbit dimension under the\nGaussian unitary group serves a non-Gaussianity witness, which we expect to be\nuniversal for multimode pure states. While proven in the discrete variable\nsetting (i.e. passive linear optics with an energy cutoff), the validity of our\nwork in the continuous variable setting does rest on a technical conjecture\nwhich we do not prove."}

However, existing constructions are largely confined to\ntwo-dimensional regular tilings, and the structural principles underlying\nhyperinvariance remain poorly understood, especially in higher dimensions. To\naddress this, we introduce a geometric criterion called angular k-uniformity,\nwhich refines standard k-uniformity and its planar variants by requiring\nisometric behavior within angular sectors of a tensor's rotationally symmetric\nlayout. This condition enables the systematic identification and construction\nof hyperinvariant holographic codes on regular hyperbolic honeycombs in\narbitrary dimension, and extends naturally to heterogeneous networks and qLEGO\narchitectures beyond regular tilings.
