Logical qubits encoded with the\nsurface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle,\nthereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the\nproduction of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the\nuse of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements.\nLogical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits\ninvolved to be synchronized.

Despite the success of SSL, there are\nstill problems, such as limited model capacity or insufficient representation\nability. Quantum SSL has become a promising alternative because it can exploit\nquantum states to enhance expression ability and learning efficiency. This\nletter proposes a Quantum SSL with entanglement augmentation method (QSEA).\nDifferent from existing Quantum SSLs, QSEA introduces an entanglement-based\nsample generation scheme and a fidelity-driven quantum loss function.\nSpecifically, QSEA constructs augmented samples by entangling an auxiliary\nqubit with the raw state and applying parameterized unitary transformations.\nThe loss function is defined using quantum fidelity, quantifying similarity\nbetween quantum representations and effectively capturing sample relations.\nExperimental results show that QSEA outperforms existing quantum\nself-supervised methods on multiple benchmarks and shows stronger stability in\ndecorrelation noise environments. This framework lays the theoretical and\npractical foundation for quantum learning systems and advances the development\nof quantum machine learning in SSL."}

More generally, localization can be\neither complete, where the strongest possible confinement is achieved, or\nincomplete, where localization terminates prematurely. On the trajectory level,\nsymmetries and conserved quantities are no longer respected and localization\ntransitions occur concurrently with violations of ergodicity. As a result, a\ngeneralized update rule emerges that effectively projects the system onto one\nof several possible time evolutions.
